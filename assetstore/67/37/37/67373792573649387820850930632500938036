Abstract
The arterial lumen is modeled by a continuous right generalized cylinder with piece-wise constant parameters. The method is based on the identification of the parameters of each piece from a series of contours extracted along an approximate axis of the artery. This curve is defined by a minimal path between the artery end-points. The contours are extracted using the Fast Marching algorithm. The identification of the axial parameters is based on a geometrical analogy with helical curves, while the identification of the surface parameters uses the Fourier series decomposition of the contours. Thus identified parameters are used as observations in a Kalman optimal estimation scheme that manages the spatial consistency from each piece to another. The method was evaluated on 46 datasets from the MICCAI 3D Segmentation in the Clinic Grand Challenge: Carotid Bifurcation Lumen Segmentation and Stenosis Grading (http://cls2009.bigr.nl).

1 Introduction
Image segmentation plays an increasing role in today's assessment of vascular diseases. Measurements inferred from the segmentation help the physician to evaluate the disease severity. For example, one important measure is the stenosis degree, indicating the percentage of lumen reduction of a pathological section compared to the healthy part of the vessel. Various approaches of vascular segmentation published over the past years are mainly based on vessel tracking and deformable models (see [6] for a review). Vessel tracking methods scan the vessel incrementally and progressively build a discrete (geometrical) representation of the vessel, usually composed by a centerline and a stacking of planar contours. It is important to note that this approach hardly exploits the 3D continuity of the vessel surface. On the other hand, deformable models are usually discrete surfaces (meshes) that deform their geometry to fit the data. The deformation is obtained by minimizing an objective function with two competitive terms: a local constraint (data attachment) and a global constraint (a priori on the geometrical shape). This approach does not provide direct access to clinically useful cross-sectional measures. This work is motivated by applications involving the segmentation and the quantification of tubular-shaped objects, e.g. blood vessels, in medical three-dimensional (3D) images. Although healthy bloodvessels have cylindrical shapes with circular cross-sections, pathologies such as atherosclerosis, may lead to quite complex deformations of the cross-sectional shape. A generalized cylinder model capable of representing complex elongated objects, using a reduced number of parameters, was proposed in [1]. The model is composed of two parts: the first one describing the axial shape by means of orthonormal bases attached to the axis, and the second one describing the surface by means of contours in the planes orthogonal to the axis. This model was called RGC-sm, which stands for right generalized cylinder state model, since the authors used the system-state formalism. According to this formalism, both components (the local base and the cross-sectional contour) corresponding to any arc-length location, can be calculated knowing only one initial base and contour, as well as their dynamics (parameters describing their variation). The main characteristics of RGC-sm are: 1. Piece-wise constant dynamics - the actual generalized cylinder is
subdivided into segments such that all the state variables within a segment are constants, and

81

2. continuity - while continuously varying the arc-length, one obtains a continuous axis and surface.
Asimilar model was recently used in [7].
In [3] we proposed an image-segmentation framework based on RGCsm, which makes use of the Kalman state estimator to determine the optimal values of the state variables in the consecutive cylinder pieces. The key point in this algorithm is an appropriate computation of image-based observations. For each cylinder piece, these observations are to be inferred from two contours extracted in the planes bounding the piece. In this paper we assume that the contour-extraction problem is resolved. The focus is a geometry-based reasoning that leads to the retrieval of the observations to be used as input of the Kalman filter.
Thus, this paper is organized as follows: section 2 describes the RGCsm model, section 3 describes our vessel segmentation algorithm based on RGC-sm and, finally, section 4 presents the results of evaluating the method on 15 training and 31 testing datasets from the MICCAI 3D Segmentation in the Clinic Grand Challenge: Carotid Bifurcation Lumen Segmentation and Stenosis Grading (http://cls2009.bigr.nl).
2 Right generalized cylinder model
The RGC-sm model is an association of a generating curve H and a stack of contours describing the surface S (see figure 1).
The model is piece-wise, i.e. it assumes that a generalized cylinder can be subdivided into pieces such that the model parameters be constant within each piece separately. Each piece Hi of the generating curve is defined by its length ∆i , curvature Κi , torsion τi , and by the azimuthal rotation angle i , of the local basis Γi ,(t) attached to Hi , with respect to the corresponding Frenet frame (see figure 2).
Each piece Si of the surface is a continuous stack of contours ci(t,ω)
defined by a tuple{Zi,∆i,}, where Zi= Z{ i,l  C; - q ≤ l ≤ + q} represents
the Fourier coefficients describing the first contour in the piece, and Λi = {λi,l  C; - q ≤ l ≤ + q} is an ordered set of 2 q + 1 coefficients linearly transforming the contour along Hi.

Both coefficient sets are used to define contours as:

ci (t,ω) = (λi,l (t − ti ) + zi ,l )e jlω , l =−q

where t and ω respectively are arc-length and azimuthal parameters. The number q of harmonics controls the level of details of the contours, and thus of the whole generalized cylinder surface. Each surface piece Si is connected to the corresponding generating curve piece Hi by the following equation:

where hi(t) is the spatial location of the origin of Γi (t) , which belongs
to Hi. The entire model is thus:

Figure 4 shows the global flowchart of the proposed algorithm for vascular segmentation. The vascular segment of interest is delimited by two points interactively given by the user. The Kalman state estimator (KSE) [8] (see section 3.1) is used to control the vessel tracking along an approximate axis between these points (see section 3.3). It predicts the 3D locations, orientations and shapes of the contours that delimit the consecutive cylinder pieces. The observation vector, coding the RGCsm parameters of the i -th piece (see section 3.2), is computed from the result of the contour extraction performed in the predicted plane (see section 3.4). The observation is then filtered by the KSE to produce a corrected estimate of the parameters, which is expected to smooth out the possible errors of the contours and initial axis extraction. Only the very first contour remains uncorrected. The KSE adapts the tracking speed to the complexity of the local vascular shapes (axial and superficial). In complex shapes (high local changes of curvature, for example) the length of the cylinder piece is automatically reduced. This occurs when the predicted contours are too different from the observations.

3.1 Kalman stateestimator
The KSE, [8], addresses the general problem of estimation of the x -
dimensional state x Rx of a discrete-time controlled process that is
governed by the linear stochastic difference equation:

xi = A xi−1 + B ui w+ i−1
with a m- dimensional measurement m Rm:

(4)

mi = H xi + vi

(5)

where the random variables wi and vi represent, respectively, the
process and measurement noises. These noises are assumed to be statistically independent between them, white and with normal probability distributions:

p(w) : N (0,Q) p(v) : N(0, R)

(6)

where Q and R are the respective covariance matrices.

The xx x matrix A in equation 4 relates the state at the previous step i - 1
to the state at the current step i , in the absence of either a driving
function or process noise. The x x u matrix B relates the optional u -

85

dimensional control input u  Ru to the state x. The mx x matrix H in the measurement equation 5 relates the state to the measurement m .

The KSE algorithm is basically a loop that updates the ``time'' i by

projecting (predicting) the previous estimated state

X^ i-1

Xto

and

then correcting this prediction using the current measurement mi to

obtain the newly estimated (innovated) state X^ . Furthermore, a

measure of the error estimation of the process is kept in the x x x

matrices Pi . The pseudo-code of the KSE is written in algorithm 1:

Algorithm 1: Kalman state estimator basic algorithm as presented in [12].
The key to use a KSE is the definition of the matrices A, B, H, Q, R, the initialization vector X^ 0, the process noise vector P0, the time-depending input vector ui and measurement vector mi . Furthermore, a stop criteria
has to be defined in order to terminate the prediction-innovation loop. These definitions are discussed in the next section.
3.1.1 Kalman equations for vessel tracking and RGC construction
The matrices and vectors used in our KSE-based vessel tracking algorithm are:
The measurement vector m contains the information needed to
construct the vector defined in equation 3.

86 Leonardo Flórez Valencia, Jacques Azencot, Maciej Orkisz

The state vector x contains the information needed to construct the vector defined in equation 3, together with its velocity (x © [M

M´]T ). In other words, it also describes RGC-sm pieces with the rate

of change of each RGC-sm parameter.

ui = 0 ^ B = 0. In other words, there are no external inputs.

[ ]I I
A = 0 0

: i.e. predicted pieces are just projections of

previously estimated pieces, taking into account the velocity, as in

the Newton's laws.

H = I : i.e. measured pieces, in the absence of noise, should be
considered as good estimations.

Experimentally, we fixed the noise covariance matrices to Q = 10-3. I and R = 10-3. I.

Accordingly, the initial process noise matrix P0 = 10-3. I.

After each iteration, the estimated state

is

the

resulting

RGC-sm, thus constructing the final cylindrical representation of the

chosen vessel.

3.2 Retrievalofobservationsfrom imagedata

Without loss of generality, we explain the process for the first cylinder

piece. Under the assumption of constant curvature and torsion, each

piece of H is a helix, and a geometrical reasoning demonstrates that its

parameters can be recovered if the frames Γ0 , Γ1 , at its extremities, as
well as their origin locations h0 and h1, are available. Owing to a lack of
space here, this reasoning will be given in a future publication. The

remaining parameters are calculated using the Fourier decompositions

of Γ1

We first give main equations that lead from Γ0 the RGC-sm parameters. Then we explain the

image processing steps that lead from the initial image and seed-points

to these intermediate data.

3.2.1 Calculation ofmodelparameters
We first compute the transition operators, respectively rotation and translation, between the extremities:

(7) (8)

Φ is a rotation operator and one of the properties of the rotation matrices is the existence of Θ and Ξ such that Φ ( 0, ∆0) - Φ ( 0, ∆0)T = 2 sin Θ.Ξ , where Θ is the rotation angle and the non-zero elements of the antisymmetric matrix Ξ compose the vector defining the rotation axis. Moreover, it can be demonstrated that Φ (t1, t2) = exp ((t2 - t1). Ψ), where Ψ is proportional to Ξ : Ψ = µΞ. In the case where Φ describes the rotation between two frames attached to a helix, the coefficient µ is also involved in the calculation of the curvature and torsion of the helix. Indeed, these are proportional (via µ ) to the cosine and sine of the angle ϕ that represents the “slope”' of the helix. Hence, the second step is the subtraction:

Φ Φ(0,∆0 ) − (0, ∆0 )Τ =

.

Θ = arcsin 1 a2 + b2 + c2 2

It can be demonstrated that a, b, c can be used to calculate ϕ, then µ:

which in turn permits the computation of the axial parameters: (9)
Numerical stability problems might arise when Φ ( 0, ∆0) = I, which

88 Leonardo Flórez Valencia, Jacques Azencot, Maciej Orkisz

occurs when H0 is a straight line segment. This is checked after the computation of Γ0 and Γ1 , and the parameters, in this case, are set as
follows: [k0 τ0 v0 ∆0 ]T= [0 0 0 | h1 - h0| ]T. The last step is the computation
of the parameters describing the linear evolution of the Fourier decomposition of the contours:

3.3 Approximateaxialshapeextraction

As mentioned above, in the current implementation, the vessel tracking

is performed along an coarsely describes the

axial shape of the vessel, is constructed as follows:

1. A binary image1 B (p), is computed from the initial image f (p),

using locally adaptive thresholds fL , fH that coarsely separate the vascular lumen from the background. These thresholds are defined

using the results presented in [4]. According to that work, the

vascular lumen intensities along the carotids have two properties:

(a) the global lower threshold values are in the range [140HU,

420HU], and (b) the local threshold values vary almost linearly

along the vessel axis. Using these properties, the lumen is

segmented using a flooding algorithm that computes thresholds

depending on the distance of each voxel to user-given seeds. The

local threshold properties are computed using the Robust Automatic

Threshold Selection (RATS) scheme [9].

2. An Euclidean distance map E(p), is computed within B(p) using

the algorithm proposed in [10]. Finally, a cost function F(p) =

1 1+E(p)

is

algorithm (as proposed in [13]), which

used finds

ordered along the shape and connecting the seed-points even in the

presence of lumen discontinuities (severe stenoses). These points

are expected to be located near the center of the vessel due to the cost

function F(p), related to the distance map E (p)

3.4 Contoursextraction
The planar contours are extracted using the fast marching (FM) method [11]. FM is a front propagation technique that provides a set of (counterclockwise) ordered points Ci = {c i, k : 0 ≤ k < K}. This technique needs

the definition of a potential field P(p) expected to be maximum at discontinuities (edges) and minimum within uniform regions. We use the potentials proposed in [2], where the native image intensities f (p) along with image discontinuities represented by the gradient magnitude
f (p) are used:

(11)

The function K (.) of a scalar µ is defined as follows:

K(u,α ,β )=1+ exp

−u

−α β

, (12)

where α is a shift, β is a signed sharpness parameter and d (p) is a mono-
dimensional derivative of | f (p)| along the direction normal to the front. With α1 =0, α2 = f1 , α3 = fH , β1 = 100 , β2 = 1 and β3 = -1 , this potential function P strongly decreases the propagation speed when the front moves beyond local maxima of the gradient norm (i.e. beyond borders of the arteries) or beyond the range [ f1, f1] of luminal intensities, defined as described in previous subsection. Furthermore, in this work the authors recommend that the FM propagation should be stopped at time value T when the growth of the area A encompassed by the front becomes very slow, which is characterized by a large value of ∆T/∆A . Actually, at each iteration we compute the mean m T/A and the standard deviation σT/A of ∆T/∆A and the propagation stops when ∆T/∆A> m T/A + 10 σT/A. All the coefficient settings correspond to the experimental values from [2].

that its first vector is along h0- C0,0 , and the

third one is orthogonal to both. Z0 is calculated as the Fourier series

corresponding to C0 , using the harmonics up to the third order (q = 3),

which is sufficient to represent reasonably complex cross-sections.

Stenosis quantification from the reconstructed model involves an analytic calculation of the cross-sectional areas directly from Fourier coefficients, while the diameters are computed from discrete contours.

4 Results
Both lumen segmentation and stenosis quantification were evaluated on 15 training and 31 testing carotid CTA datasets available within the Carotid Bifurcation Algorithm Evaluation Framework. Details of the evaluation methodology can be found on the web page of the challenge [5]. Figure 5 displays an example of segmentation result.

Stenosis quantification was evaluated by calculating the difference between the calculated percentage and the one provided by the reference standard, using both cross-sectional areas and diameters. The results are presented in table 1.

Four criteria were evaluated to assess the lumen segmentation: Dice similarity index, mean surface distance, RMS surface distance and maximal surface distance. Table 2 summarizes the results obtained.

The average running time of our algorithm, including lumen segmentation, stenosis grading and display of intermediate and final results, was 3.7 ∠1.3 minutos.

5 Discussion and conclusion
RGC-sm is a powerful tool that permits a concise description of complex generalized cylindrical shapes. The theoretical framework permits the reconstruction of a continuous surface corresponding to the lumen, based on a limited number of discrete contours. Additionally, the Kalman estimator permits a correction of the observation errors when these remain within a reasonable range. However, our current implementation of the image processing steps devised to provide the observations is clearly not optimal. The initial rough extraction of the axial shape begins by a thresholding step, which is prone to errors when neighboring structures have a similar intensity range. Actually, this initial curve needs to be quite well-centered within the lumen. Indeed, as the Fast Marching algorithm in planes orthogonal to this initial curve

92 Leonardo Flórez Valencia, Jacques Azencot, Maciej Orkisz
starts from the intersection between the plane and the curve, this intersection has to fall within the lumen, otherwise the contour extraction fails. Failures are also observed when the curve is located within the lumen, close to a poorly contrasted boundary. In fact, the use of an always inflating deformable contour, such as the Fast Marching front, is uneasy, since the speed function and stopping criteria hardly can cope with all possible configurations (nearby veins, calcifications, etc.). Furthermore, 2D Fast Marching does not exploit the 3D continuity of the vascular lumen, which might be helpful in some complicated situations. Future work will be oriented towards an implementation that do not require the initial extraction of an approximate axial shape and that perform a piece-wise local 3D boundary extraction. Let us also note that the current implementation was designed with an implicit assumption (constraint) that the seed-points are also end-points, and are given at "easy" locations, i.e. healthy circular cross-sections without neighboring structures "stuck" to the artery of interest. Hence, the method had difficulties in datasets where the seed-point in the internal carotid artery was located either close to the bifurcation, so that our method segmented a too short part of the artery, or near the skull where the assumption of the absence of neighboring structures did not hold. Further work is necessary to cope with seed-points located anywhere within the vessel of interest.
