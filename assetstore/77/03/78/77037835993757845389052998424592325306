Abstract. Sorting genomes by translocations is a classic combinatorial problem
in genome rearrangements. The translocation distance for signed genomes can
be computed exactly in polynomial time, but for unsigned genomes the prob-
lem becomes NP-Hard and the current best approximation ratio is 1.5+ε. In this
paper, we investigate the problem of sorting unsigned genomes by transloca-
tions. Firstly, we propose a tighter lower bound of the optimal solution by an-
alyzing some special sub-permutations; then, by exploiting the two well-known
algorithms for approximating the maximum independent set on graphs with a
bounded degree and for set packing with sets of bounded size, we devise a new
polynomial-time approximation algorithm, improving the approximation ratio to
1.408+ε, where ε = O(1/ logn).
1 Introduction
Genome rearrangement is an important area in computational biology, and some combi-
natorial problems in this area have attracted more and more attention during the last two
decades. Genome rearrangement mainly deals with sorting genomes by a series of re-
arrangement operations. Sankoff et al. proposed three basic rearrangement operations:
reversal, transposition and translocation [1]. Subsequently, sorting single-chromosome
genome by reversals or transpositions and sorting multi-chromosome genome by translo-
cations have become three famous problems and researchers devoted a lot of effort on
these problems, both on determining their computational complexity and on designing
efficient algorithms.
Generally speaking, a translocation is an operation swapping the tails of two chro-
mosomes. For sorting signed genomes by translocations, the problem was first studied
by Kececioglu and Ravi [2]. Hannenhalli devised a polynomial time exact algorithm
which runs in O(n3) [3]. Wang et al. improved the running time to O(n2) [4], which
was further improved to O(n

log n) by Ozery-Flato and Shamir [5]. Wang et al. and
Bergeron et al. showed that the translocation distance can be computed by a formula in
linear time [6, 7].
Zhu and Wang proved that the problem for sorting unsigned genomes by translo-
cations is NP-hard and APX-hard [8]. In [2], Kececioglu and Ravi also gave a ratio-

genomes. Cui et al. presented a 1.75-approximation algorithm [9], and further improved
the approximation ratio to 1.5 + ε [10].
The problem of sorting unsigned genome by translocations has a close relationship
with the maximum cycle decomposition of the breakpoint graph, which is also NP-
hard [11]. Finding a good cycle decomposition of the breakpoint graph is critical to
approximating the translocation distance [9, 10] and some other genome rearrangement
distances, such as sorting by reversals [12], sorting by double cut and join [13]. About
ten years ago, Caprara and Rizzi proposed a better cycle decomposition method and
improved the approximation ratio for sorting unsigned genomes by reversals [14]. Ba-
sically, this method exploits the approximation algorithm for computing a maximum
independent set on bounded degree graphs [15] and computing a maximum set pack-
ing with each set containing bounded number of elements [16]. Recently, Chen et al.
used this method to improve the approximation ratio of the sorting multi-chromosome
genomes by double cut and join problem to 139 + ε [17].
Our contribution In this paper, we devised a new approximation algorithm for sort-
ing unsigned genomes by translocations with an approximation ratio of 1.408 + ε. We
present a new lower bound for the optimal solution by identifying a special local struc-
ture in the breakpoint graph, then devise a cycle decomposition algorithm by combining
the approximation algorithm for computing a maximum independent set on bounded
degree graphs and for computing a maximum set packing with bounded set size, and
enumerate the cycle decomposition of sub-permutations with no more than O(log n)
genes.
The paper is organized as follows. In the preliminaries section, we review some
notions about the sorting unsigned genomes by translocations problem. In section 3, we
review the relation between sorting signed genomes with sorting unsigned genomes. In
section 4, we introduce the new lower bound and then our new algorithm. In section 5,
we analyze the approximation ratio. We conclude the paper in section 6.
2 Preliminaries
In this section, we present the precise definition of a translocation operation and review
some useful notions.
Gene, Chromosome and Genome We use a signed integer to represent a
directed gene and use an unsigned integer to represent a gene with unknown direction.
A chromosome, denoted by a permutation, is a sequence of genes and a genome is a
set of chromosomes. A gene which lies at the end of some linear chromosome is called
an ending gene. Throughout this paper, without loss of generality, we assume that the
target genome Y is perfect, i.e., each chromosome in Y is a segment of consecutive
positive integers, for example, i, i + 1, i + 2, . . . , j − 1, j, and, the concatenation of
these chromosomes forms the identity permutation (i.e., no duplication of any gene is
allowed). In the context of sorting genomes, the comparative order of the genes in the
same chromosome matters, but the order of chromosomes and the direction of a whole
chromosome does not matter, which implies that each chromosome can be viewed in
both directions. In the case of signed genomes, a chromosome 〈ai, ai+1, · · · , aj〉 is
Approximation Algorithm for Sorting by Translocations 3
equivalent to 〈−aj , · · · ,−ai+1,−ai〉; and in the case of unsigned genomes, a chromo-
some 〈bi, bi+1, · · · , bj〉 is equivalent to 〈bj , · · · , bi+1, bi〉.
Signed and Unsigned Translocations For two signed chromosomes S =
[x1, x2, · · · , xn] and T = [y1, y2, · · · , ym] in a genome, a translocation swaps the seg-
ments in the chromosomes and generates two new chromosomes. If we cut the adja-
cency (xi, xi+1) (1 < i < n) in S and (yj , yj+1) (1 < j < m) in T . There are two
cases of two new resulting chromosomes (See Figure 1),

– prefix-suffix translocation: S′ = [x1, · · · , xi,−yj , · · · ,−y1], and
T ′ = [−ym, · · · ,−yj+1, xi+1, · · · , xn].
Note that each signed chromosome can be viewed in both directions, such as T =
[y1, y2, · · · , ym] or T = [−ym,−ym−1, · · · ,−y1].
If S = [x1, x2, · · · , xn] and T = [y1, y2, · · · , ym] are two unsigned genomes, then
the resulting new chromosomes in each case are shown as follows,
– prefix-prefix translocation: S′ = [x1, · · · , xi, yj+1, · · · , ym], and
T ′ = [y1, · · · , yj , xi+1, · · · , xn].
– prefix-suffix translocation: S′ = [x1, · · · , xi, yj , · · · , y1], and
T ′ = [ym, · · · , yj+1, xi+1, · · · , xn].
Again, an unsigned chromosome T can also be treated as T = [y1, y2, · · · , ym] or T =
[ym, ym−1, · · · , y1]. It can be seen that to transform a genome X into Y with unsigned
translocations alone, the set of genes, the number of chromosomes and the set of ending
genes in the chromosomes inX and Y must all be the same. This can be checked easily,
so we just assume that the input genomes satisfy these conditions. Now, we formally
put forward the problem we investigate in this paper.
Problem Description: Sorting Unsigned Genomes by Translocations.
Input: Two multi-chromosome genomes X and Y , where Y is perfect.
Question: Is there a sequence of unsigned translocations ρ1, ρ2, . . ., ρt to transform
X into Y , and t is minimized? The minimum t is called the unsigned translocation
distance between X and Y .
4 Jiang, et al.
Recall that if the input genomes are signed and the operation is signed transloca-
tions, then the problem becomes sorting signed genomes by translocations.
3 Sorting Signed Genomes
First, let us review the computation method for signed genomes that was originally
devised by Hannenhalli [3]. The breakpoint graph plays a critical role in computing the
signed translocation distance.
3.1 The breakpoint graph of signed genomes
Given signed genomes A and B, the breakpoint graph Gs(A,B) can be obtained as
follows: For every chromosome S = [x1, x2, . . . , xni ] of A, replace each xi with an or-
dered pair (l(xi), r(xi)) of vertices. If xi is positive, then (l(xi), r(xi)) = (xti, x
h
i ); and
if xi is negative, then (l(xi), r(xi)) = (xhi , x
t
i). If the genes xi and xi+1 are adjacent in
A, then we connect r(xi) and l(xi+1) by a black edge in Gs(A,B). If the genes xi and
xi+1 are adjacent in B, then we connect r(xi) and l(xi+1) by a gray edge in Gs(A,B).
Every vertex (except the ones at the two ends of a chromosome) inGs(A,B) is incident
to one black and one gray edge. Therefore, Gs(A,B) can be uniquely decomposed into
cycles, on which the black edges and gray edges appears alternatively. A cycle contain-
ing exactly i black (gray) edges is called an i-cycle.
3.2 The signed translocation distance formula
Let S = [x1, x2, . . . , xni ] be a chromosome in A. A sub-permutation, denoted by SP ,
is a segment [xi, xi+1, . . . , xi+l] of at least three genes in S such that there is another
segment [yj , yj+1, . . . , yj+l] of the same length in some chromosome T ofB satisfying
that
– {|xi|, |xi+1|, . . . , |xi+l|} = {|yj |, |yj+1|, . . . , |yi+l|};
– |xi| = |yj |, |xi+l| = |yj+l|;
– [xi, xi+1, . . . , xi+l] 6= [yj , yj+1, . . . , yj+l].
Here, xi and xi+l are the two ending genes of the SP , (r(xi), l(xi+1)) and
(r(xi+l−1), l(xi+l)) are the two boundary black edges of the SP . A minSP is a SP
not containing any other SP . If all minSP s in Gs(A,B) are in a SP , say, I , and the
total number of minSP s is even, then I is an even isolation.
Let b (resp. c,s) be the number of black edges (resp. cycles, minSP s) in Gs(A,B).
Let f be a remaining index, which is defined as follows: 1) f=1 if s is odd, 2) f=2
if there is an even isolation, and 3) f=0 otherwise. Hannenhalli showed the following
formula to compute the translocation distance ds(A,B) between A and B [3].
Lemma 1. ds(A,B) = b− c+ s+ f .
As we only focus on designing an approximation algorithm for unsigned genomes (by
converting them to some signed ones), we ignore f throughout the paper. But we cer-
tainly need to focus on approximating s.

3.3 The breakpoint graph of unsigned genomes
The breakpoint graph for two unsigned genomes is a bit different from that of signed
genomes. In the breakpoint graph G(X,Y ) of two unsigned genomes X and Y , each
vertex corresponds to a gene in X; two genes are connected by a black edge if they
appear consecutively in some chromosome ofX and two genes are connected by a gray
edge if they appear consecutively in some chromosome of Y . So the breakpoint graph
G(X,Y ) can be decomposed into a set of edge-disjoint cycles, denoted by D, and on
each cycle, the black edge and gray edge appears alternatively. Each ending gene of X
and Y is incident to only one black edge and one gray edge; and each of the rest genes
is incident to exactly two blacks edge and two gray edges. Thus, the ways to decompose
G(X,Y ) into cycles might not be unique.
If we split each non-ending vertex xi inG(X,Y ) into two vertices l(xi),r(xi), make
l(xi) incident to one black edge and one gray edge which is incident to xi in G(X,Y ),
and make r(xi) incident to the other black edge and gray edge which is incident to
xi in G(X,Y ), we obtain a the new graph D, which is called a cycle decomposition
of G(X,Y ). In the next subsection, we will show that each cycle decomposition of
G(X,Y ) is identical to the breakpoint graph Gs(X¯, Y¯ ), where X¯ and Y¯ is obtained by
assigning a proper sign to each gene in X and Y .
In unsigned genomes, a candidate SP (abbreviated asCSP ), is made of a substring
of at least three genes in X such that another substring exists in Y with the same gene
content, but with a different gene order. A candidateminSP (abbreviated asCminSP )
is a candidate SP not containing any other candidate SP .
3.4 Converting unsigned genomes into signed ones
Once we have a cycle decomposition D ofG(X,Y ), we can obtain two signed genomes
X¯ and Y¯ by assigning a sign to each gene in X and Y , so that Gs(X¯, Y¯ ) = D. (We can
view X¯ = A and Y¯ = B in Lemma 1.) As aforementioned, all genes in Y are positive.
Therefore, all gray edges in Gs(X¯, Y¯ ) have the form ((xi)h, (xi + 1)t).
Next, we show how to assign a proper sign to each gene in X (to obtain X¯). An
ending gene is positive if it lies at the same (i.e., both left or both right) ends of some
chromosome in X and some chromosome in Y ; otherwise, it is negative in X . For a
non-ending gene xi, according to the two gray edges, ((xi)h, (xi + 1)t) and ((xi −
1)h, (xi)t) in the cycle decomposition, we assign xi positive if ((xi − 1)h, l(xi)) is
a gray edge in the given cycle decomposition; if ((xi − 1)h, r(xi)) is a gray edge in
the given cycle decomposition, then xi is assigned a negative sign. See Figure 2 for an
example.
As the translocation distance between signed genomes can be computed in poly-
nomial time, a natural and efficient method to solve the problem of sorting unsigned
genomes by translocations is to assign proper signs to the unsigned genome, or equiv-
alently, to find a proper cycle decomposition of the breakpoint graph. The following
lemma shows that the influence by changing the sign of some gene is local.
Lemma 2. Let ∆s and ∆c be the difference of minSP s and cycles by changing the
sign of some gene respectively. ∆s, ∆c ∈ {-1,0,1}

sition of (b).
4 Our Algorithm
To solve the problem of sorting unsigned genomes by translocations, we aim at find-
ing a proper cycle decomposition of the breakpoint graph. But the maximum cycle
decomposition of the breakpoint graph between two unsigned genomes is NP-hard, an
intuitive method is to decompose as many cycles as possible. Cui [10] showed that all
the possible 1-cycles could be kept in the cycle decomposition by the following lemma.
Lemma 3. There exists some optimal cycle decompositions containing all the existing
1-cycles.
4.1 A new lower bound
To design a better approximation algorithm, we need a lower bound better than this
lemma. We achieve this by looking at some special CSP’s which could be included in
some optimal solution.
Let I be a CSP and let Is = [xi, xi+1, . . . , xj ] be a cycle decomposition of I in
Gs(X¯, Y¯ ), if there exists a cycle C in Is that contains the two black edges (possi-
bly some other black edges), (r(xi), l(xi+1)) and (r(xj−1), l(xj)), then C is called
the boundary cycle of Is. Based on the traversal order of the four vertices (r(xi),
l(xi+1)), (r(xj−1) and l(xj)) in cycle C, there are two kinds of boundary cycles. If
the boundary cycle C has the form [r(xi), l(xi+1), . . . , r(xj−1), l(xj), . . . , r(xi)], C
is positive; if C has the form [r(xi), l(xi+1), . . . , l(xj), r(xj−1), . . . , r(xi)], C is neg-
ative. If there exists another cycle C ′ containing the two black edges (r(xi−1), l(xi))
and (r(xj), l(xj+1)) such that if we change the signs of xi and xj , C ′ and C become
two other cycles C
′′
and C
′′′
, then we say that C is a removable boundary cycle, C ′ is
a critical cycle for C, and Is is a removable candidate SP , abbreviated as RCSP . An
example on candidate removable CSP is given in Figure 3. We comment that the two

boundary black edges might be in two different cycles, but we will mostly focus on the
boundary cycles in this paper.
ACSP that contains no less thanO(log n) genes is called a longCSP , otherwise it
is short. A CSP is bad if it is short and there is no other short CSP containing it. Note
that by scanning each chromosome from left to right, we could find out the (disjoint)
bad CSP s one by one.
Let Is be a CSP , we say that a cycle decomposition Ds of the breakpoint graph of
Is is feasible if it maximize c-s, where c is the number of cycles in Ds, s is the number
of minSP s in Ds. A feasible cycle decomposition Ds is efficient, if Is is a minSP .
The overall idea of our algorithm is as follows. We first identify all bad CSPs. For
each bad CSP (with length O(log n)), we enumerate all its possible cycle decomposi-
tions in polynomial time. Then, depending on the properties of these cycle decomposi-
tions (shown in Lemma 5, Lemma 6 and Lemma 7), we pick certain cycle decomposi-
tions. After that, we select disjoint 2-cycles and 3-cycles which have not been picked
yet (using approximate subroutines for the maximum independent set and maximum
set packing). Finally, we process the remaining bad CSPs optimally while at least keep-
ing the number of cycles computed by the independent set and set packing (shown in
Lemma 1). Due to space constraint, we omit the proofs of the following lemmas.
Lemma 4. There exists some optimal cycle decomposition in which the two ending
genes of a CSP are either both positive or both negative.
Lemma 5. Let I = [xi, xi+1, . . . , xj ] be a CSP , if there is no efficient cycle decompo-
sition of the breakpoint graph of I , then any feasible cycle decomposition could appear
as a component in some optimal cycle decomposition.
Lemma 6. Let I = [xi, xi+1, . . . , xj ] be a CSP , if there is no efficient cycle decompo-
sition of the breakpoint graph of I containing a boundary cycle, then any efficient cycle
decomposition could appear as a component in some optimal cycle decomposition.
Lemma 7. Let I = [xi, xi+1, . . . , xj ] be a CSP , the boundary cycles in any efficient
cycle decomposition are of the same type, then for any efficient cycle decomposition
with a boundary cycle, all the cycles except the boundary cycle could appear in some
optimal cycle decomposition.
Based on Lemma 7, we immediately have the following corollary.
Corollary 1. Let I=[xi, xi+1, . . ., xj] be aCSP , whose breakpoint graph has efficient
cycle decompositions and the boundary cycles in these efficient cycle decompositions
are of two types. Then there exists at least one type of boundary cycle such that for any
efficient cycle decomposition with a boundary cycle of this type, all the cycles except
the boundary cycle could appear in some optimal cycle decomposition.
The difficulty here to handle the case in Corollary 1 is that if the boundary cycles
in these efficient cycle decompositions are of two types, we do not know which type
we should use. We will carefully deal with this case when designing the algorithm. The
rough idea is to decide the signs of some 2- and 3-cycle which contains xi or xj , using
approximate solution for Maximum Independent Set (for graphs of degree at most 4) or
Maximum Set Packing (for sets of size at most 3). Then we can decide the type of the
boundary cycle, as the cycle decomposition is known from the outside of this cycle.
Approximation Algorithm for Sorting by Translocations 9
4.2 The algorithm
Now, we are ready to describe our approximation algorithm. Here we give an approxi-
mate cycle decomposition and then use the exact algorithm for the signed case to obtain
the solution. The basic idea of our cycle decomposition algorithm is as follows: (I) We
identify all the bad CSPs, and fix the signs of each gene in each bad CSP by a feasible
cycle decomposition. Since the size of a bad CSP is at most O(log n), we can obtain
all the feasible cycle decompositions in polynomial time. Note that these bad CSPs are
disjoint. (II) We try to obtain a large number of 2-cycles for the genes outside of the
bad CSPs (possibly including the ending genes of bad CSPs) using an approximate al-
gorithm for Maximum Independent Set (for graphs with degree at most 4). (III) We try
to obtain a large number of 2-cycles and 3-cycles for the genes outside of the bad CSPs
(possibly including the ending genes of bad CSPs) using an approximate algorithm for
the Maximum Set Packing (for sets of size at most 3). (IV) We choose the cycle decom-
position with a bigger number of cycles obtained at step (II) and (III). (V) Arbitrarily
fix the sign for the rest of genes to get a signed version of the problem and use the exact
algorithm for the signed version to get a solution. Let us look at the details.
Identifying all bad CSPs: From Lemma 3, we know that each chromosome is split into
segments by the 1-cycles. So we deal with each segment respectively. Firstly, it is easy
to see that by scanning each segment from left to right, we can identify all CSPs. Some
CSPs may (completely) overlap, i.e., some CSP is entirely contained in another CSP. A
CSP containing no more thanO(log n) elements (i.e., is short) and not contained in any
other short CSP is a bad CSP. Secondly, by scanning a CSP with no more thanO(log n)
elements from the left to right, we identify the longest CSP with no more than O(log n)
elements (if any) which is a bad CSP, and then identify other bad CSPs from the right
end of the newly found bad CSP. This can be done as follows: Start from the leftmost
gene t1 of a segment T , identify tq such that q = O(log n). Then set i ← 1, j ← q
and check whether T [i..j] is a CSP by sorting all the elements in T [i..j], and if there
is no gap between two neighbors in the sorted list, then T [i..j] is a CSP. If the test is
negative, then decrease j by one and repeat the process. When T [i..j] is found to be a
bad CSP, then set i ← j + 1, j ← i + q − 1 and repeat the process. If no T [i..j] is
found to be a bad CSP, then set i← 2, j ← q+1 and repeat. So, the above procedure to
consecutively identify the bad CSPs can be completed in n× log n×O(log n log log n)
= O(n log2 n log log n) time.
Fix the sign of genes in a bad CSP I: For each bad CSP, we can enumerate all possible
cycle decompositions in O(2logn) time. We have to consider the following cases:
Case 1: No efficient cycle decomposition of I can be found. We arbitrarily select
any feasible cycle decomposition (by Lemma 5).
Case 2: No efficient cycle decomposition exists and no efficient cycle decompo-
sition containing a boundary cycle of I can be found. We can arbitrarily select any
efficient cycle decomposition (by Lemma 6).
Case 3: The boundary cycles in all efficient cycle decompositions of I are of the
same type. We arbitrarily select any efficient cycle decomposition with a boundary cycle
and keep all the cycles except the boundary cycle (by Lemma 7).
Case 4: There are two types of boundary cycles in efficient cycle decompositions.
According to Corollary 1, we can use one type of efficient cycle decomposition. How-
10 Jiang, et al.
ever, at present we do not know which type to choose. Thus, we will decide which type
of boundary cycle we have to use after steps (II), (III) and (IV).
Finding a large number of 2-cycles: In order to get a large number of 2-cycles, we
construct a 2-cycle graph G′ as follows: For each possible 2-cycle satisfies: (a) it is
not a boundary cycle from a bad CSP , and (b) it is not contained entirely in any bad
CSP , we create a vertex (corresponding to such a 2-cycle) in G′. There is an edge
between two vertices if and only if their corresponding 2-cycles share edges. It should
be emphasized that for a bad CSP I (including Case 4), we do not consider any 2-cycle
entirely contained in I when constructing G′.
Lemma 8. There exists an approximation algorithm with ratio 57 − ε for any ε > 0 for
the maximum independent set problem on a graph with maximum degree 4.
Proof. Refer to reference [15]. uunionsq
It is known that the constructed graph G′ has degree at most 6, but can be converted
to a graph of degree at most 4 while searching for the independent set [14]. Thus, we
can use the ratio 57 − ε approximate algorithm here.
Finding a large number of 2-cycles and 3-cycles: Another strategy is to get a large
number of 2-cycles and 3-cycles together. Based on the two input genomes, we con-
struct an instance of the maximum set packing problem. Here each set contains the
edges from a possible 2-cycle or a possible 3-cycle which again satisfies (a) and (b).
Lemma 9. There is a ratio 37−ε approximate algorithm for any ε > 0 for the maximum
set packing problem with set size at most 3.
Proof. Refer to reference [16]. uunionsq

4 Construct the 2-cycle graph G′ and compute an approximate independent set I1 of G′
as the selected 2-cycles.
5 Construct all the sets for 2- and 3-cycles and compute an approximate set packing S1.
6 Choose the greater one of I1 and S1. Assign signs to each gene in the selected
2-cycles or 2,3-cycles.
7 For each bad CSP of Case 4, choose the type of the boundary cycle according to S′
(if possible).
8 For each of the remaining bad CSP , arbitrarily choose an efficient cycle
decomposition for it.
9 Arbitrarily assign signs to the rest of genes so that every gene has a sign.
Approximation Algorithm for Sorting by Translocations 11
We can use the ratio 37 − ε approximate algorithm here. After we obtain the ratio
5
7 − ε solution S1 for G′ and the ratio 37 − ε solution S2 for the constructed instance
of the maximum set packing problem, we choose the solution S′ which is one of S1
and S2 with bigger number of cycles. We refer S∗ as the approximate partial cycle
decomposition. Now the sign of some of the ending genes for bad CSPs of Case 4 might
be determined by S′ and we can determine the type of boundary cycles accordingly and
select all the cycles in the CSPs based on Corollary 2. Finally, for the genes that have
not been assigned signs, we can arbitrarily fix the sign and thus obtain an instance of
the signed translocation problem. The complete algorithm is given separately.
5 Proof of the Approximation Ratio
To analyze the performance of our algorithm, we need to compare our algorithm to some
optimal cycle decomposition. So we assume that the optimal cycle decomposition S∗
fulfils Lemma 4, 5, 6, 7, and Corollary 1, i.e., in the optimal cycle decomposition, we
have
1. The ending genes of any CSP are either both negative or both positive;
2. If the ending genes of a CSP are both positive, then the cycle decomposition for
this CSP is either efficient or feasible;
3. If the ending genes of a CSP are both negative, then by changing them to positive,
the CSP becomes a minSP .
Lemma 10. Let c′2 and c′3 be the number of 2-cycles and 3-cycles in S2 obtained by
our algorithm, c∗2 and c
∗
3 be the number of 2-cycles and 3-cycles in the optimal cycle
decomposition, c∗a be the number of boundary 2-cycles and 3-cycles in the optimal cycle
decomposition, then we have c′2 + c
′
3 ≥ (3/7− ε)(c∗2 + c∗3 − c∗a).
Proof. Let c¯2 and c¯3 be the number of 2-cycles and 3-cycles entirely contained in the
bad CSP s, from Lemma 7 and Corollary 1, we know that, for any bad CSP , all cy-
cles except the boundary cycle in our cycle decomposition also appears in the optimal
cycle decomposition. Let c˜2 and c˜3 be the number of 2-cycles and 3-cycles not en-
tirely contained in any bad CSP , which are figured out at Step 5. So c′2=c¯2+c˜2 and
c′3=c¯3+c˜3. Let c˜∗2 and c˜
∗
3 be the number of 2-cycles and 3-cycles not entirely contained
in any bad CSP in the optimal cycle decomposition. So c∗2=c¯∗2+c˜
∗
2 and c
∗
3=c¯∗3+c˜
∗
3.
Since we do not consider any boundary cycle at Step 5, from Lemma 9, we have
c˜2 + c˜3 ≥ (3/7 − ε)(c˜∗2 + c˜∗3 − c∗a). By adding c¯2 and c¯3 to both side, we have
c′2 + c
′
3 ≥ (3/7− ε)(c∗2 + c∗3 − c∗a). uunionsq
Corollary 2. Let c′′2 be the number of 2-cycles returned by our algorithm, c∗2 be the
number of 2-cycles in the optimal cycle decomposition, c∗b be the number of boundary
2-cycles in the optimal cycle decomposition, then we have c′′2 ≥ (5/7− ε)(c∗2 − c∗b).
Lemma 11. If the algorithm Cycle-Decomposition(•) converts a long CSP into a SP ,
then either it also appears in some optimal cycle decomposition or it contains at least
one cycle of length at least 4 or O(log n) number of 2,3-cycles.
12 Jiang, et al.
Proof. Since the CSP is long, i.e., it contains at least O(log n) genes, then either it
contains a cycle of length at least 4 or it contains O(log n) number of 2,3-cycles. uunionsq
Lemma 12. If the algorithm Cycle-Decomposition(•) converts a bad CSP into a SP ,
either this SP also appears in some optimal cycle decomposition or the boundary cycle
is not a selected cycle.
Proof. If the CSP does not appear in any optimal cycle decomposition, it is either the
third case shown in Lemma 7 or the case shown Corollary 1, from Step 4 and 5, in either
case, the boundary cycle is not a selected cycle. uunionsq
Lemma 13. Let s be the number ofminSP s by the algorithm Cycle-Decomposition(•),
s∗ be the number of minSP s in some optimal cycle decomposition, ci be the num-
ber of i-cycles computed by the algorithm Cycle-Decomposition(•), ca be the num-
ber of boundary 2,3-cycles returned by Step 8. We have s ≤ s∗ +∑i≥4 ci + (c2 +
c3)/O(log n) + ca.
Proof. We use an amortized analysis. For each minSP by the algorithm
Cycle-Decomposition(•), there are three cases.
1. It is also a minSP of some optimal cycle decomposition, then we are done.
2. It is long, from Lemma 11, there are O(log n) selected 2,3-cycles or at least one
i-cycle (i ≥ 4) in it.
3. It is bad, from Lemma 12, the boundary cycle is not a selected cycle but a cycle
counted in ca,
uunionsq
Corollary 3. Let s be the number ofminSP s by the algorithm Cycle-Decomposition(•),
s∗ be the number of minSP s in some optimal cycle decomposition, ci be the number
of i-cycles by the algorithm Cycle-Decomposition(•), cb be the number of boundary
2-cycles returned by Step 8. We have s ≤ s∗ +∑i≥3 ci + (c2)/O(log n) + cb.
Theorem 1. The algorithm Cycle-Decomposition(•) approximates the translocation
distance within a ratio α = 1.408 + ε.
Proof. Omitted due to space constraint. uunionsq
6 Concluding Remarks
Sorting unsigned genomes by translocations is a famous NP-hard problem in genome
arrangements. It is a great challenge to obtain smaller approximation ratio. In this paper,
we improve the approximation ratio from 1.5 + ε to 1.408 + ε, based on a new lower
bound and some cycle decomposition methods. What is more, the description of our
algorithm and the analysis is much simpler than what is in [10]. Devising algorithms
with smaller approximation ratio is a valuable future work.
