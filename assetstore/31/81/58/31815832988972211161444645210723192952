THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF BLOCK INTERCHANGES NEEDED TO SORT A PERMUTATION AND A RECENT
RESULT OF STANLEY
MIKLO´ S BO´ NA1 AND RYAN FLYNN2
Abstract. We use an interesting result of probabilistic ﬂavor concerning the product of two permutations consisting of one cycle each to ﬁnd an explicit formula for the average number of block interchanges needed to sort a permutation of length n.
1. Introduction
1.1. The main deﬁnition, and the outline of this paper. Let p = p1p2 · · · pn be a permutation. A block interchange is an operation that interchanges two blocks of consecutive entries without changing the order of entries within each block. The two blocks do not need to be adjacent. Interchanging the blocks pipi+1 · · · pi+a and pjpj+1 · · · pj+b with i + a < pj results in the permutation
p1p2 · · · pi−1pj pj+1 · · · pj+bpi+a+1 · · · pj−1pipi+1 · · · pi+apj+b+1 · · · pn. For instance, if p = 3417562, then interchanging the block of the ﬁrst two entries with the block of the last three entries results in the permutation 5621734.
In this paper, we are going to compute the average number of block interchanges to sort a permutation of length n. The methods used in the proof are surprising for several reasons. First, our enumeration problem will lead us to an interesting question on the symmetric group that is very easy to ask and that is of probabilistic ﬂavor. Second, this question then turns out to be surprisingly diﬃcult to answer– the conjectured answer of one of the authors has only recently been proved by Richard Stanley [6], whose proof was not elementary.
1.2. Earlier Results and Further Deﬁnitions. The ﬁrst signiﬁcant result on the topic of sorting by block interchanges is by D. A. Christie [3], who provided a direct way of determining the number of block interchanges necessary to sort any given permutation p. The following deﬁnition was crucial to his results.
Deﬁnition 1. The cycle graph G(p) of the permutation p = p1p2 · · · pn is a directed graph on vertex set {0, 1, · · · , n} and 2n edges that are colored either black or gray as follows. Set p0 = 0.
(1) For 0 ≤ i ≤ n, there is a black edge from pi to pi−1, where the indices are to be read modulo n + 1, and
(2) For 0 ≤ i ≤ n, there is a gray edge from i to i + 1, where the indices are to be read modulo n + 1.

It is straightforward to show that G(p) has a unique decomposition into edgedisjoint directed cycles in which the colors of the edges alternate. Let c(G(p)) be the number of directed cycles in this decomposition of G(p). The main enumerative result of [3] is the following formula. In the rest of this paper, permutations of length n will be called n-permutations, for shortness.

Theorem 1. The number of block interchanges needed to sort the n-permutation

p

is

n+1−c(G(p)) 2

.

Note that in particular this implies that n+1 and c(G(p)) are always of the same

parity.

Christie

has

also

provided

an

that

p

using

n+1−c(G(p)) 2

block

interchanges. As the identity permutation is the only n-permutation that takes zero

block interchanges to sort, it is the only n-permutation p satisfying c(G(p)) = n+ 1.

Theorem 1 shows that in order to ﬁnd the average number an of block inter-

changes needed to sort an n-permutation, we will need the average value of c(G(p))

for such permutations. The following deﬁnition [4] will be useful.

Deﬁnition 2. The Hultman number SH (n, k) is the number of n-permutations p satisfying c(G(p)) = k.

So the Hultman numbers are somewhat analogous to the signless Stirling numbers of the ﬁrst kind that count n-permutations with k cycles.
This is a good place to point out that in this paper, we will sometimes discuss cycles of the permutation p in the traditional sense, which are not to be confused with the directed cycles of G(p), counted by c(G(p)). Following [4], the number of cycles of the permutation p will be denoted by c(Γ(s)). Indeed, the cycles of a permutation p are equivalent to the directed cycles of the graph Γ(p) in which there is an edge from i to j if p(i) = j. For instance, if p = 1234, then c(Γ(p)) = 4, while c(G(p)) = 5.
The following recent theorem of Doignon and Labarre [4] brings the Hultman numbers closer to the topic of enumerating permutations according to their cycle structure (in the traditional sense). Let Sn denote the symmetric group of degree n.

Theorem 2. The Hultman number SH (n, k) is equal to the number of ways to obtain the cycle (12.. · · · n(n + 1)) ∈ Sn+1 as a product qr of permutations, where q ∈ Sn+1 is any cycle of length n + 1, and the permutation r ∈ Sn+1 has exactly k cycles, that is c(Γ(r)) = k.

2. Our Main Result
The following immediate consequence of Theorem 2 is more suitable for our purposes.
Corollary 1. The Hultman number SH (n, k) is equal to the number of (n + 1)cycles q so that the product (12 · · · n(n + 1))q is a permutation with exactly k cycles, that is, c(Γ((12 · · · n(n + 1))q) = k.
Example 1. For any ﬁxed n, we have SH (n, n+1) = 1 since c(G(p)) = n+1 if and only if p is the identity permutation. And indeed, there is exactly one (n + 1)-cycle (in fact, one permutation) q ∈ Sn+1 so that (12.. · · · n(n + 1))q has n + 1 cycles, namely q = (12 · · · n(n + 1))−1 = (1(n + 1)n · · · 2).
In other words, ﬁnding the average of the numbers c(G(p)) over all n-permutations p is equivalent to ﬁnding the average of the numbers c(Γ((12.. · · · n(n + 1))q), where q is an (n + 1)-cycle.
Let us consider the product s = (12 · · · n)z, where z is a cycle of length n. Let us insert the entry n + 1 into z to get the permutation z′ so that n + 1 is inserted between two speciﬁc entries a and b in the following sense.
 z(i) if i ∈/ {a, n + 1},  z′(i) = n + 1 if i = a, and  b if i = n + 1.
See Figure 2 for an illustration.

The following proposition is the ﬁrst step towards describing how the Hultman numbers grow. Proposition 1. Let a, b, and z′ be deﬁned as above, and let s′ = (12 · · · (n + 1)z′. Then we have
 c(Γ(s)) − 1 if 2 ≤ a, and a − 1 and z(1) are not in the same cycle of s,  c(Γ(s′) = c(Γ(s)) + 1 if 2 ≤ a, and a − 1 and z(1) are in the same cycle of s, and  c(Γ(s)) + 1 if a = 1.

4 BONA AND FLYNN
Proof. Let us assume ﬁrst that a ≥ 2, and that a−1 is in a cycle C1 of s, and z(1) is in a diﬀerent cycle C2 of s. Let C1 = ((a − 1)b · · · ) and let C2 = (z(1) · · · n). After the insertion of n + 1 into z, the newly obtained permutation s′ = (12.. · · · (n + 1)z′ sends a − 1 to n + 1, then n + 1 to z(1), then leaves the rest of C2 unchanged till its last entry. Then it sends n back to z′(n + 1) = b, from where it continues with the rest of C1 with no change. So in s′, the cycles C1 and C2 are united, the entry n + 1 joins their union, and there is no change to the other cycles of s. See Figure 2 for an illustration.

Let us now assume that a ≥ 2, and that a − 1 and z(1) are both in the same
cycle C of s. Then C = ((a − 1)b · · · n(z(1)) · · · ). After the insertion of n + 1 into z, the newly obtained permutation s′ = (12.. · · · (n + 1)z′ sends a − 1 to n + 1, then
n + 1 to z(1), cutting oﬀ the part of C that was between a − 1 and n. So C is split into two cycles, the cycle C′ = ((a − 1)(n + 1)z(1) · · · ) and the cycle C′′ = (b · · · n). Note that s′(n) = b since z′(n + 1) = b. See Figure 2 for an illustration.
Finally, if a = 1, then s′(n + 1) = (n + 1), and the rest of the cycles of s do not
change.

Let T Cn denote the set of n-permutations that can be obtained as a product of two cycles of length n. Let an be the average number of cycles of the elements of T Cn.

.

Proof. We apply Proposition 1, with n replaced by n + 1 = 2m + 1. This means n + 1 is an odd number. So z′ is a cycle of length 2m + 2 obtained from a cycle

z of length 2m + 1 through the insertion of the maximal element 2m + 2 into one

of 2m + 1 possible positions. By Proposition 1, some of these insertions increase

c(G(s)) by one, and others decrease c(G(s)) by one, depending on whether a − 1

and z(1) are in the same cycle of s or not. The question is, of course, how many

times they will be in the same cycle of s.

Figure 4. If a − 1 and z(1) are in the same cycle of s, that cycle will split into two cycles.

This question is easily seen to be equivalent to the following question.

Question 1. Let i and j be two ﬁxed elements of the set {1, 2, · · · , h} Select an element p of T Ch at random. What is the probability that p contains i and j in the same cycle?

The ﬁrst author of this article has conjectured that the answer to this question was 1/2 for odd h. This conjecture was recently proved by Richard Stanley [6], who also settled the question for even values of h.

Theorem 3. [6] Let i and j be two ﬁxed, distinct elements of the set [h] = {1, 2, · · · , h}, where h > 1. Let x and y be two randomly selected h-cycles over [h]. Let p(h) be the probability that i and j are in the same cycle of xy. Then

p(h) =

1 12 2

if h is odd,

−

2 (h−1)(h+2)

and if h

is

even.

The proof of Lemma 1 is now straightforward. If a = 1, then a − 1 and z(1)

are equally likely to be in the same cycle or not in the same cycle of s. Therefore,

an increase of one or a decrease of one in c(G(s)) is equally likely. If, on the other

hand, a = 1, which occurs in 1/(2m + 1) of all cases, then c(G(s)) increases by one.

So

(a2m+1

.

Note that the statement of Lemma 1 holds even when m = 0, since a2 = 2 = a1 + 1.
As Theorem 3 provided a formula for P (h) for even values of h as well as odd
values, we can state and prove the analogous version of Lemma 1 for the integers
not covered there.

Proof. This is very similar to the proof of Lemma 1. If a = 1, which happens in

(2m − 1)/(2m) of all cases, then the probability of a − 1 and z(1) falling into the

same

cycle

of

s

is

by

Theorem

3.

By

Proposition

1,

in

these

cases

c(G(s)) grows by one. If a = 1, which occurs in 1/(2m + 2) of all cases, c(G(s))

always grows by one. So

which is equivalent to the statement of the lemma as can be seen after routine rearrangements.

We are now in position to state and prove our formula for the average number an of cycles in elements of T Cn.

i=1

Note that this formula produces even the correct value even for n = 1, that is, it produces the equality a1 = 1.

Proof. (of Theorem 4) The statement is now a direct consequence of Lemmas 1 and

2 if we note the telescoping sum

t i=1

1 i(i+1)

=

1−

obtained

when

summing

the values computed in Lemma 2.

Note that it is well-known that on average, an n-permutation has

n1 i=1 i

cy-

cles. This is the average value of c(Γ(p)) for a randomly selected n-permutation.

Theorem 4 shows that the average value of c(G(p)) diﬀers from this by about 1/n.

Finally, our main goal is easy to achieve.

Theorem 5. The average number of block interchanges needed to sort an n-permutation

is

Proof. By Theorem 2 and Theorem 4, the average number value of c(G(p)) over all

is

Our

follows from Theorem 1.

So the average number of block interchanges needed to sort an n-permutation is close to (n − log n)/2.

3. Remarks and Further Directions

Richard Stanley’s proof of Theorem 3 is not elementary. It uses symmetric functions, exponential generating functions, integrals, and a formula of Boccara [1]. A more combinatorial proof of the stunningly simple answer for the case of odd k would still be interesting.
As pointed out by Richard Stanley [7], there is an alternative way to obtain the result of Theorem 4 without using Theorem 3, but that proof in turn uses symmetric functions and related machinery. It is shown in Exercises 69(a) and 69(c) of [8] that

(1)

Pn(q) =

qc(Γ(p)) =

1
n+1

⌊(n−1)/2⌋
c(n + 1, n − 2i)qn−2i,

p∈T Cn

2 i=0

where, as usual, c(n, k) is a signless Stirling number of the ﬁrst kind, that is, the

number of permutations of length n with k cycles. Now an can be computed by considering Pn′ (1), which in turn can be computed by considering the well-known identity

n+1
Fn+1(x) = c(n + 1, k)xk = x(x + 1) · · · (x + n),

k=1

and then evaluating Fn′ +1(1) + Fn′ +1(−1). The present paper provides further evidence that the cycles of the graph G(p)

have various enumerative properties that are similar to the enumerative properties

of the graph Γ(p), that is, the cycles of the permutation p. This raises the question

as to which well-known properties of the Stirling numbers, such as unimodality,

log-concavity, real zeros property, hold for the Hultman numbers as well. (See for

instance Chapter 8 of [2] for deﬁnitions and basic information on these properties.)

A simple modiﬁcation is necessary since SH (n, k) = 0 if n and k are of the same parity. So let

Qn(q) =

p∈T Cn qc(Γ(p))/2 if n is even p∈T Cn q(c(Γ(p))+1)/2 if n is odd.

While the coeﬃcients of Pn(q) are all the Hultman numbers SH (n − 1, 1), SH (n−1, 2), · · · , SH (n−1, n−1), the coeﬃcients of Qn(q) are the nonzero Hultman numbers SH (n − 1, k).
Clearly, Qn(q) = Pn(q2) if n is even, and Qn(q) = qPn(q2) if n is odd. However, Exercise 69(b) of [8] shows that all roots of Pn(q) have real part 0. Hence the roots of Qn(q) are all real and non-positive, from which the log-concavity and unimodality of the coeﬃcients of Qn(q) follows. This raises the question of whether there is a combinatorial proof for the latter properties, possibly along the lines of the work

of Bruce Sagan [5] for the Stirling numbers of both kinds. Perhaps it is useful to

note that (1) and Theorem 2 imply that

SH (n, k) =

c(n + 2, k)/

n+2 2

if n − k is odd,

0 if n − k is even.

Finally, to generalize in another direction, we point out that it is very well-known (see, for example, Chapter 4 of [2]), that if we select a n-permutation p at random, and i and j are two ﬁxed, distinct positive integers at most as large as n, then the probability that p contains i and j in the same cycle is 1/2. Theorem 3 shows that if n is odd, then the set T Cn behaves just like the set Sn of all permutations in this

8 BONA AND FLYNN
aspect. This raises the question whether there are other naturally deﬁned subsets of n-permutations in which this phenomenon occurs.
Acknowledgment We are indebted to Richard Stanley for helpful discussions on various aspects of Exercises 69(a-c) of [8], and, most of all, for proving Theorem 3. We are also thankful to Anthony Labarre and Axel Hultman for bringing earlier results to our attention.
