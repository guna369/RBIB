Abstract
We present a new criterion for con uence of (possibly) non-terminating leftlinear term rewriting systems. The criterion is based on certain strong joinability properties of parallel critical pairs. We show how this criterion relates to other well-known results, consider some special cases and discuss some possible extensions.
1 Introduction and Overview
Computation formalisms which are based on rewriting systems heavily rely on the fundamental properties of termination and con uence. For terminating and con uent systems normal forms exist and are unique, irrespective of the computation (rewriting) strategy. For non-terminating but con uent systems, normal forms need not exist, however, if a normal form exists, it is still unique. More generally, any (possibly innite) diverging computations can be joined again. In some cases, non-termination is inherently unavoidable, in other cases it may be very di cult to verify this property. Hence the problem of proving con uence (with or without termination) is of fundamental importance. For abstract reduction (or abstract rewriting) systems (ARSs for short) it is well-known that, under termination, con uence is equivalent to local con uence, via Newman's Lemma. For proving con uence of non-terminating ARSs, however, one usually needs much stronger local con uence properties. A very interesting unifying framework, based on so-called decreasing diagrams, for localizing con uence proofs (even without

termination) in the general setting of labelled abstract rewriting systems has recently been developed by van Oostrom ( Oos94a]). For term rewriting systems (TRSs for short), which are ARSs with some additional structure, local con uence can be characterized by con uence of critical pairs as expressed by the well-known Critical Pair Lemma. Hence, for ( nite) terminating TRSs, this critical pair test yields decidability of con uence. For non-terminating TRSs, however, the situation is much more di cult again. Even the absence of critical pairs does not guarantee con uence, as there exist non-terminating, non-overlapping TRSs which are (locally con uent but) not con uent (cf. e.g. Hue80]). These counterexamples must necessarily be non-left-linear.1 In fact, TRSs which are left-linear and non-overlapping, i.e., orthogonal, are con uent (cf. e.g. Ros73]). This fundamentally important positive result has been considerably generalized by Huet ( Hue80]) and further by Toyama ( Toy88]) by allowing critical pairs, but imposing certain strong joinability properties on them (cf. Theorems 3.2, 3.5 and 3.7 below). The rst result, Theorem 3.2, however, has the severe drawback that it additionally requires right-linearity, a `rather unnatural condition' as pointed out in Hue80]. Theorems 3.5 and 3.7 of Huet/Toyama are particularly interesting, since they do not require right-linearity. They are proved by showing strong con uence of parallel reduction, making essential use of the above mentioned particular joinability properties of (ordinary) critical pairs. Our main new (and quite natural) idea now is that in order to ensure strong con uence of parallel reduction, one may also de ne and investigate the corresponding notion of parallel critical pairs. This new concept indeed turns out to be very useful, since we are able to state and prove a new su cient condition for strong con uence of parallel reduction (cf. Theorem 4.11) which is based on certain joinability properties for parallel critical pairs (cf. De nition 4.8). Actually, the idea behind parallel critical pairs is not completely new. Implicitly, parallel critical pairs { or, more precisely, parallel critical peaks { are at the heart of so-called critical pair criteria for completion of terminating TRSs (cf. WB86], Kuc85], KMN88], BD88]), where certain (ordinary) critical pairs can be ignored during completion since they are redundant. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. After introducing the necessary terminology, we present in Section 3 the known related results, give an example where none of the known con uence criteria applies, and motivate the introduction of parallel critical pairs. The main result of the paper, Theorem 4.11, is proved in Section 4. Its relation to the previous results, various illuminating examples and other related work are discussed in Section 5. Finally we conclude by discussing directions for further extending and generalizing our approach.
1Some interesting e orts for isolating the essence of the source of non-con uence in this case are described e.g. in OT94], TO95]. A decidable su cient (syntactic) condition for con uence of nonleft-linear, non-terminating TRSs is given in TO95].

2 Preliminaries

We assume familiarity with the basic theory of abstract reduction systems as well as of the special case of term rewriting systems. For comprehensive surveys see e.g. Klo92], DJ90], AM90], Pla94]. Furthermore we also use some basic facts about uni cation theory (cf. e.g. BS94] for a recent survey).

2.1 Abstract Reduction Systems

An abstract reduction system (ARS) is a pair A = hA; !i consisting of a (base) set A and a binary relation ! A A also called (abstract) reduction or (abstract) rewrite relation. We use the standard notations !+, ! , != (or ! 1) for the transitive, transitive-re exive and re exive closure, respectively, of !. The notations for the inverse relations are obtained by `mirroring', e.g., we use for the inverse of !. Relation composition is denoted by . Two elements a; b 2 A are said to be joinable (denoted by a # b) if there exists c 2 A : a ! c b. If a ! b, we call b a reduct of a. The identity relation on A is given by idA = f(a; a) j a 2 Ag. De nition 2.1 (con uence properties) Let A = hA; !i be an ARS. Then A (or !)

is con uent (CONF) if ! ! . is Church-Rosser (CR) if $ ! . is locally con uent or weakly Church-Rosser (WCR) if ! ! is strongly con uent (SCR) if ! ! = . is subcommutative (WCR 1) if ! != = . is uniformly con uent (WCR1) if ! idA (! ). has the diamond property (3) if ! ! .

.

Note that if the reduction relation ! of A = hA; !i is re exive, then the diamond property, subcommutativity and uniform con uence (of A) are equivalent. Con uence of an ARS A = hA; !i can be characterized in various equivalent ways.
For instance, we have:
CR(!) () CONF(!) () CR(! ) () ! ! :

Justi ed by the equivalence of the rst two properties above and following a widespread convention we shall subsequently denote the con uence property by CR.
We note that due to the equivalence CR(!) () CR(! ) (by idempotence of ), for proving con uence of ! it su ces to prove con uence of for some reduction relation with the same transitive-re exive closure, i.e. with =! .

The next well-known result summarizes the relationships between the various con uence properties introduced in De nition 2.1 above. It provides interesting su cient criteria for proving con uence by strengthened versions of local con uence.
Theorem 2.2 (con uence by strengthening local con uence) Let A = hA; !i be an ARS. Then the following implications hold:
3 =) WCR1 =) WCR 1 =) SCR =) CR :
Local con uence (WCR) does not imply con uence (CR) in general, but only under the additional assumption of termination. This fundamentally important result, known as Newman's Lemma, is at the heart of many con uence proofs in the literature.
Here, an ARS A = hA; !i (or !) is said to be terminating if there exists no in nite reduction sequence a0 ! a1 ! a2 ! : : : (of elements of A). A (or !) is called complete
(or convergent) if it is con uent and terminating.
Theorem 2.3 (Newman's Lemma, New42]) A terminating ARS A = hA; !i is con uent if and only if it is locally con uent.

2.2 Term Rewriting Systems

A term rewriting system R (over some set T (F; V) of terms) may be viewed as the

rAeRwSritheTr(uFle;sVl);!!rR2i

where
R (l; r

!2 RT

or simply ! (F; V) with V

is the ar(r)

rewrite relation induced by the V ar(l)). A term is linear if no

variable occurs more than once in it. A rewrite rule l ! r is said to be left-linear /

right-linear if l / r is linear. A TRS is left-linear / right-linear if all its rules are

left-linear / right-linear.

For substitutions we use pre x notation, sometimes omitting parentheses, e.g., we write (s) or s to denote the result of applying the substitution to the term s. The domain and the variable range of a substitution are denoted by Dom( ) (or Dom ) and
VRan( ) (or VRan ), respectively.

Positions (of terms) are also de ned as usual, and denoted by p, q etc.. They are ordered by as usual. The `empty' root position is denoted by . Concatenation of positions is denoted by juxtaposition. If p q we say that p is above q (or q is below
p). For subtracting positions we use n, i.e., we write p n q = q0 if p = qq0. Two positions p and q are said to be parallel (or independent, disjoint), denoted by p k q, if neither
p q nor q p. These notations extend in a straightforward way to sets of positions.

The set of positions of a term s is denoted by Pos(s). The sets of variable positions
and of non-variable, i.e., function symbol, positions of s are denoted by VPos(s) and FPos(s), respectively. The subterm of s at some position p 2 Pos(s) is denoted by s=p. In order to indicate that t is the subterm of s at position p 2 Pos(s), we also write s = s p = t]. The result of replacing in s the subterm at position p 2 Pos(s) by t is
denoted by s p t]. The result of (simultaneously) replacing in s the subterms at some
set P = fp1; : : : ; png P os(s) of parallel positions (of s) by t1; : : : ; tn, respectively, is

additionally that s=pi = ti for all i, 1 i n.

If a term s rewrites to t at position p 2 Pos(s) using rule l ! r and substitution ,

i.e., s=p = l, t = s p r], this is indicated by using the notation s !p; ;l!r t or,

(syntactic) equality s = t (cf. BS94] for further details).

For testing local con uence of TRSs the following notion originating from KB70] is fundamental.

De nition 2.4 (critical pairs) Let R be a TRS and let l ! r, l0 ! r0 be two rules of R that w.l.o.g. do not have any common variable.2 Suppose l=p, with p 2 FP os(l), and l0 are uni able with mgu , where VRan( )\(V ar(l)nV ar(l=p)) = ;.3 Then the pair of reducts h( l) p r0]; ri is called a critical pair of R, determined by overlapping l0 ! r0 into l ! r at position p. The divergence ( l) p r0] p l ! r is the corresponding critical peak. If
p = , we speak of an outside critical peak (or critical overlay)and outside critical pair, respectively. Otherwise, i.e., if p > , we speak of an inside critical peak and inside critical pair, respectively (following Toy88]). If the two rules are renamed versions of the same rule we do not consider the case p = (which gives only rise to improper
divergences). The set of all critical pairs between rules of R is denoted by CP(R). If CP(R) = ;, R is said to be non-overlapping. It is called orthogonal if it is non-
overlapping and left-linear.

Observe the asymmetry in the de nition of critical pairs. This entails in particular,

that for namely

hat1c;rti2tiicaalnodvehrtl2a;yt1ti1.

s ! t2 we always get two corresponding critical pairs,
Moreover we note, that a critical pair may correspond

to (i.e., be obtained from) several distinct critical peaks (if taking into account the

position of the inside rewrite step and the applied rules).4

Lemma 2.5 (Critical Pair Lemma, Hue80])
A TRS is locally con uent if and only if all its critical pairs are joinable.

Combining Newman's Lemma and the Critical Pair Lemma yields the following fundamental result.
2Note that considering renamed versions of the same rule of R is allowed here, too. 3This variable condition ensures that the mgu does not introduce unnecessary identi cations of variables in l. In case that the mgu of t = l=p and l0 is taken such that no new variables are introduced (which is always possible), this condition is vacuously sati ed. 4For the sake of readability we dispense here with a completely formal de nition of critical peaks which is straightforward.

Theorem 2.6 ( KB70])
A terminating TRS is con uent (hence complete) if and only if all its critical pairs are joinable.

3 Known Results and Motivating Examples
Without termination, showing con uence of a TRS is much more di cult. For leftlinear systems, a few results relying on strong con uence properties are known.
De nition 3.1 (strongly closed, Hue80]) A TRS R is called strongly closed, which we denote by SCCP(R),5 if for every critical pair ht1; t2i there exist terms t3, t4 such that t1 ! t3 = t2 and t1 != t4 t2. Theorem 3.2 (strong con uence by strong closedness, Hue80])
A left- and right-linear strongly closed TRS is strongly con uent, hence also con uent.
Proof: The proof in Hue80] is by a complete case analysis for one-step divergences of the form t1 s ! t2 exploiting strong closedness for the case that t1 s ! t2
corresponds to an instance of a critical peak (note that right-linearity is needed for the case of a variable overlap).

The following very nice counterexample shows that right-linearity cannot be dropped in Theorem 3.2.

Example 3.3 (due to J.-J. Levy as cited in Hue80])

The TRS

g(b; b) a0 f(x; x) f(x; x) f(a; a) b0 g(x; x) g(x; x)

is left-linear, non-right-linear and non-terminating. Moreover, it is easily veri ed that
R is strongly closed, but non-con uent. In fact, we have e.g. f(a0; a0) f(a; a) !
g(b0; b0) but f(a0; a0) and g(b0; b0) do not have a common reduct (cf. Figure 1).

For left-linear, but not necessarily right-linear TRSs one may use the following approach
of Huet ( Hue80]). Let R be a TRS. Then the parallel reduction relation (induced by vRe)r,if?y??ik!ngR or simply ???k!, is de ned as the smallest re exive relation containing ! and
s1???k!t1 ^ : : : sn???k!tn =) f(s1; : : : ; sn)???k!f(t1; : : :; tn)

Subsequently, we shall tacitly make use of some basic properties of parallel positions and parallel reduction, in particular the following ones:

can be obtained by extraction, stripping o the common context.

Clearly, parallel and ordinary reduction are related as follows: ! ???k! ! , hence also ! = ???k! . Thus, for showing con uence of !, it su ces to prove (strong) con uence of ???k!.

De nition 3.4 (parallel closed, Hue80]) A TRS R is called parallel closed if for every critical pair ht1; t2i of R we have: t1???k!t2.

Theorem 3.5 (subcommutativity of parallel reduction by parallel closedness, Hue80]) If R is a left-linear parallel closed TRS, then parallel reduction (in R) is subcommutative (WCR 1(???k!)), hence R is con uent.

Proof: The ingenious proof in Hue80] proceeds by considering parallel one-step di-

vergences of the form t P `P- and Q-redexes' which

Toyama ( Toy88]) observed that, in Theorem 3.5 above, the condition that all critical pairs are parallel closed can be weakened without losing strong con uence of parallel reduction.

sizes of those `P- and Q-redexes' which are a ected in both steps ignoring, however, overlaying redexes.

Before proceeding let us elaborate a bit on variations of critical pair conditions for ensuring con uence of left-linear TRSs. Huet's result above states that

(1) s???k!t for every critical pair hs; ti of R

su ces for ensuring con uence. Surprisingly, it still seems to be unknown whether any of the following conditions also su ces (see DJK91], Problem 13 of J.-J. Levy).

(2) s???k!t or t???k!s, for every critical pair hs; ti of R. (3) s != t or t != s, for every critical pair hs; ti of R. (4) t???k!s for every critical pair hs; ti of R. (5) t != s for every critical pair hs; ti of R.

Clearly, the following implications hold between these conditions: (5) =) (3) =) (2), (5) =) (4) =) (2). We remark that due to Theorem 3.2 potential counterexamples
for (3) and (5) would have to be (besides left-linear) non-right-linear, non-terminating and non-orthogonal, hence overlapping. Unfortunately, our approach developed below does not solve any of these open problems. For motivating our approach to showing con uence via strong con uence of parallel reduction let us now consider the following modi ed version of Levy's counterexample 3.3 above.

Example 3.8 (no known criterion applicable)

is left-linear, but not right-linear, and non-terminating (cf. Figure 3). Moreover, it is con uent which cannot be inferred from Theorem 3.7 since e.g. the inside critical peak
f(a0; a) f(a; a) ! b is not parallel closed. Theorem 3.2 isn't applicable either, due to non-right-linearity of R, though R is strongly closed. Nevertheless, parallel reduction (in R) is strongly con uent (as will be shown). For instance, we observe that the divergence f(a0; a0) ?k? f(a; a) ! b can be `strongly closed' via f(a0; a0) ! b (or b ! f(a0; a0)). In Example 3.3 we had the divergence f(a0; a0) ?k? f(a; a) ! g(b; b) which could only be closed via g(b; b) ! f(a; a)???k!f(a0; a0), but not `strongly', i.e., there was no term t with f(a0; a0) ! t ?k? g(b; b). Furthermore we note that in both examples in the parallel step f(a; a)???k!f(a0; a0) two parallel (inner) redexes are contracted both of
which are critical w.r.t. the other outside step.

Figure 3: (partial) reduction graph for Example 3.8 Intuitively, the observations above suggest to analyse more carefully local divergences where in one parallel step several (parallel) redex positions are critical w.r.t. the other step. From a more abstract point of view this means to study the following questions:
(1) What are critical peaks / pairs for the parallel reduction relation? (2) Which conditions on the corresponding critical peaks / pairs for parallel reduction
guarantee strong con uence? For (1) we shall introduce the notion of parallel critical peaks / pairs. In fact, De nition
4.1 below only accounts for critical divergences of the form t1 ?k? s ! t2. However,
this type of divergences (for parallel reduction) will turn out to be su cient for char-
acterizing strong con uence of ???k! (cf. Lemma 4.9 below). Concerning (2) we shall
present a parallel critical pair condition (cf. De nition 4.8) which indeed su ces for
guaranteing strong con uence of ???k! (cf. Theorem 4.11).

versions of the same rules, we do not consider the case p = (which gives only rise
to improper divergences). The set of all parallel critical pairs between rules of R is denoted by PCP(R). A parallel critical peak (and its corresponding parallel critical

In order to get some intuition for the introduced notion of parallel critical pairs / peaks and their computation let us give two simple examples.

peak of order 2, namely f(c; e) f1;2g ?k? f(g(b); h(b; d)) ! a, obtained either directly

by overlapping in parallel the last two rules into the rst, or recursively from both

critical peaks of order 1 by an additional superposition. Hence, we have

Proof: Routine, by a straightforward peak analysis analogous to the situation for

ordinary critical pairs (as it is used in the proof of the Critical Pair Lemma 2.5).

Next we introduce the central condition on parallel critical pairs that will enable us to prove strong con uence of parallel reduction.
De nition 4.8 (parallel critical pair condition) We say that a TRS R satis es the parallel critical pair condition PCPC (PCPC(R) for short) if for every parallel critical peak D : t1 P ?k? s ! t2 of R the following holds:

In fact, Lemma 4.9 can also be obtained as a special case from the following easy results about abstract reduction relations.

properties hold:

Now we are prepared for the main result of the paper.

Theorem 4.11 (strong con uence of parallel reduction via parallel critical pairs) If a left-linear TRS R satis es the parallel critical pair condition PCPC, then parallel reduction (in R) is strongly con uent (more succinctly: PCPC(R) =) SCR(???k!)), and hence, (ordinary reduction ! in) R is also con uent. Proof: Let R be a left-linear TRS satisfying PCPC(R). According to Lemma 4.9 it
su ces to show that whenever we have a local divergence of the form

D : t1 ?k? s ! t2 ;

there exists a term t3 such that

t1 ! t3 ?k? t2 :

Hence, suppose s reduces to

now

Since non-overlapping TRSs have no critical pairs, hence also no parallel critical pairs, we obtain as a direct consequence of Theorem 4.11 the following well-known result.
Corollary 4.12 (cf. e.g. Ros73])
Any orthogonal TRS is con uent. 16

For readers which are familiar with the proof of Huet/Toyama for Theorem 3.7 we remark that one crucial di erence between their proof (of Theorem 3.7) and ours (of The-

induction hypothesis, whereas we proceed as described, namely by exploiting case (iii)
of the parallel critical pair condition PCPC(R). Interestingly, these two approaches
seem to be incompatible, as the examples below suggest.

5 Discussion and Related Work

We give (non-terminating) examples showing that the presented con uence criteria SCCP, CPCHT and PCPC are not comparable with each other. In fact, for the former two this is well-known.

Example 5.1 (Example 3.8

the (proper) parallel critical peak f(a0; a0) ?k? f(a; a) ! b we have f(a0; a0) ! b, hence

Moreover, the strongly closed criterion SCCP is also not applicable, because R is not

right-linear.

Example 5.2 (left- and right-linear case: PCPC ; CPCHT; SCCP)

The TRS

R

8>>>< >>>:

f

(a) a c d b

! ! ! ! !

f (g(b; g(c; c) d b d

b))

is left- and right-linear (and non-terminating). Moreover, it is easily checked that R satis es PCPC(R), but neither CPCHT(R) nor SCCP(R).

Example 5.3 (left- and right-linear case: SCCP ; PCPC)

The TRS

R

=

8>>>>< >>>>:

f(a; b) a b c c c

! ! ! ! ! !

c a0 b0 f(a0; b) f(a; b0) f(a; b)

is left- and right-linear (and non-terminating). Furthermore, as it is easy to check,
we have SCCP(R) but neither CPCHT(R) nor PCPC(R). This means that R is
strongly con uent. Note, however, that parallel reduction is only con uent here, but not strongly con uent.

17

Example 5.4 (left-linear case: CPCHT ; PCPC)

The TRS

R

8>>< >>:

f(a; a) a
f(b; x) f(x; b)

! ! ! !

g(f(a; a)) b g(f(x; x)) g(f(x; x))

is left-linear (and non-terminating). Furthermore, it is obviously parallel closed, i.e.,

However, the proper

parallel critical pair hf

pair condition is not joinable

from left to right, i.e., f(b; b) ! g(f(a; a)) does not hold).

The last example shows in particular, that CPCHT is not subsumed in general by PCPC. However, there is one special case where CPCHT is indeed (properly) subsumed by PCPC, namely when there are no proper parallel critical pairs (but only ordinary inside ones). In that case, parallel closedness of all inside critical pairs implies conditions (ii) and (iii) of PCPC, according to CPCHT(ii). This is obvious for PCPC(ii), and PCPC(iii) only has to hold for (ordinary) inside critical peaks which is guaranteed again by CPCHT(ii). Finally, let us brie y discuss related work and possible extensions of our approach. First of all, it seems rather straightforward to generalize our approach to a `commutation setting' analogous to the one of Toyama ( Toy88]) mentioned above for Theorem 3.7. Furthermore, we would like to mention one possible source of re nements for Theorem 4.11 (and related critical pair based con uence criteria) which is based on making use of the ambiguity of rewriting. More precisely, it may be the case that a parallel critical

example ilustrates this kind of re nement.

f(b) f(a) ! f(f(a)), which is strongly joinable in the sense of PCPC(i), due to

f(f(a)) ! f(b). Hence, parallel reduction in R is strongly con uent.

Similar re nements are also possible for Theorem 3.7. Another direction of extending our approach is to combine it with the recent results of van Oostrom ( Oos94b]) who showed that the approach of Huet/Toyama can be generalized by replacing parallel reduction steps by the more general so-called (complete)

18

developments, using essentially the same proof structure as in Theorem 3.7.10 The

basic idea of developments roughly is that a set of rewrite steps is considered to be

parallel if a `parallel extraction' of all the steps in the set is possible ( Oos94b]). This

implies (with p

for instance, q for some

that

It seems that

our approach via parallel critical pairs developed in this paper and the approach of van

Oostrom generalizing the notion of being `parallel' are `orthogonal' to each other, hence

it should be possible to combine both as well as the corresponding proof structures.

Similarly, it is conceivable that our approach can also be combined with (proof techniques for) con uence results for the higher-order rewrite systems of MN94].

Last but not least we think that the notion of parallel critical pairs that we have explicitly introduced here might turn out to be fruitful for other purposes, too. But this remains to be seen.

comments and Paul Taylor for his diagrams.

Final Note: It should be mentioned that Yoshihito Toyama, after having read (a
longer version of) this paper, informed the author ( Toy95]) about the existence of another very early paper, namely \Y. Toyama: On the Church-Rosser property of term rewriting systems, NTT ECL Technical Report 17672 (Dec. 23, 1981), in Japanese", containing very similar ideas and results. The relationships between the latter paper and ours as well as possible extensions and re nements will be investigated in joint future research.
