Towards the Effective Use of Formal Logic in the
Teaching of Discrete Math
Jaime Boho´rquez1 and Camilo Rocha2
 Abstract— Traditionally, the teaching of Mathematical Logic
has treated the subject as an object of study without considering
its practical utility for improving effective reasoning and wri-
ting of mathematical proofs. The Dijkstra/Scholten equational
calculus answers these concerns. Its application has given rise to
a style of proving called ‘the calculational approach’. Courses
on Discrete Mathematics and Algorithm’s Design have been
taught in Colombian higher education institutions with success
for more than 3 years. Recently, we have finished the first
phase of a software tool for proof processing using this calculus.
The goal pursued for this utility is the support of the learning
process in these courses as well as to eventually assist in the
program design and derivation process. We present instances
of the accomplishments of this teaching methodology in terms
of elegant proof style; and evidence of the results on teaching
quality.

I. USING EQUALITY TO CALCULATE
Using equality to perform mathematical operations has been
a long exercised technique despite the fact that most of the
time we are not aware of doing so. This notion, as a general
concept, is well captured by the Leibniz definition of Equality
[11, page 291]:
Two terms are the same (eadem) if one can be
substituted for the other without altering the truth of 
any statement (salva veritate). If we have A and B,
and A enters into some true proposition, and the
substitution of  B for A wherever it appears results
in a new proposition that is likewise true, and if this
can be done for every proposition, then A and B are
said to be the same; and conversely, if  A and B are
the same, they can be substituted for one another as
I have said. Terms that are the same are also called
coincident (coincidentia).
This simple but deep principle, known as the Leibniz rule,
is the basis for most of the ideas and work this document is
about. As an example of the use of the Leibniz rule, consider
the following classical high school proof of a well known
trigonometric identity:
Proposition 1: 1 + tan2 θ = sec2 θ
Proof:
sec2 θ

sin2 θ+cos2 θ

sin2 θ
cos2 θ + 1
=  Definition of  tan, arithmetic 
1 + tan2 θ
The use of Leibniz rule is present in every proof step3 of 
the presented proof. For example, in the first proof step, it is
used to substitute sec2 θ by 1cos2 θ because we already know
that this two terms are the same, which allows to conclude
that the terms in the first and the third line are the same or
equal. Then, by appealing to the transitivity of the equally, the
first and the last terms are equal; the identity holds.
The calculational proof system proposed by Dijkstra and
Scholten (the E  logical calculus) is based, primarily, on the
principles of the Leibniz rule. Equational Logic (as it is
also called the E  logical calculus) has had an impact in
the presentation of proofs in computer science research and
education, and its ideas can be also viewed as an interesting
discovery in logic, although this fact has so far remained
largely unnoticed. A canonical description of the E  calculus
as a classical logical system can be found in [9]. In that article,
Lifschitz convincingly argues that notation used by the E 
calculus has the same expressive power as the ones of Hilbert
and Gentzen, and has also the same deductive potential for
developing formal proofs.
As you might have wondered, the E  calculus is not only
useful in the trigonometric domain. We have used it for the
teaching of discrete mathematics in undergraduate courses,
following the ideas of Gries & Schneider in [5], and for
teaching and researching in the design of algorithms.
But this calculus is not only based on Leibniz rule. Its de-ductive power is enhanced upon the implicit use of symmetry
and associativity rules for the different operators, as well as
extended by ‘directed inequivalences’ (such as the inequality
relations < and ≤ in numerical contexts, and the implication
connective (⇒) in logical calculations) through transitivity and
monotonicity rules.
For example, if  ↑ is a binary operator on the integers
denoting the maximum of its two operands (and having more
3We call a proof step a sequence of three lines, where the first and the
third ones are the expressions becoming equal by the application of Leibniz
rule, while the second one -the hint (delimited by  and )- is the Leibniz
premise (v.gr. A = B). For example, the presented proof consists of five
proof steps. This proof format was first proposed Wim H.J. Feijen, adopted
and extensively used by Dijkstra and Scholten and then extended by Gries
and Schneider.

the properties of idempotency, symmetry and associativity;
also the addition distributes over it. We define the absolute
value of an integer |x| = x ↑ −x. We want to prove that
|x +y| ≤ |x|+ |y|, knowing that x ≤ x↑y ∧ y ≤ x↑y (i.e.
the maximum is an upper bound of its operands):
Proposition 2: |x + y| ≤ |x| + |y|

As you have noticed, the ≥ relation was used as a step
connector due to its monotonic and (combined) transitivity
properties. The use of the symmetry and associativity proper-
ties of  ↑ is not mentioned.
I I .  THE NATURE OF EQUATIONAL LOGIC
Traditionally, mathematical logic has been essentially consi-
dered as an object of study, widely appreciated for supplying a
language to accurately describe or express our understanding.
Surprisingly enough, what everybody beginning its studyexpects, applying logic for actually making deductions -the
study of the relationship of a theorem to the structure of its
proof- has been virtually ignored by logicians. However, it was
the need of computer programmers for a precise and practical
reasoning apparatus, what caused equational logic to come
about.
In the same way as uninterpreted manipulation of algebraic
equations was discovered to be a powerful and useful cal-
culating tool by the end of the Middle Ages, formal logic -
being the ultimate uninterpreted symbol manipulation system-
finally evolved into a calculational method with those same
qualities, for proving theorems and formally deriving solutions
to algorithmic problems.
As a pleasant, but not quite unexpected result, (at least, to
the practioners of this method) the effectiveness of calcula-
tional proofs is proving to be an effective way of teaching
mathematics and rigorous thinking.
We briefly explain what makes equational logic special
and different from the Hilbert and Gentzen logical calculi.
Equational logic approach is of an algebraic nature resembling
the one employed by Halmos and Givant in his book ‘Logic
as Algebra’ [8].
Basically, with regard to propositional calculus, the lan-
guage of equational logic includes, besides the usual proposi-
tional connectives and variables, the logical constants true and
false. Equational logic interprets predicates and propositional
formulas as boolean expressions, that is, propositional variable
symbols are interpreted as variables that can take values on
the boolean type: Bool = {true,false}, and the usual logical
connectives are interpreted as the corrresponding boolean
operators. Through the E  calculus, boolean variables can be
substituted for by other boolean expresions.
This way, propositional logic becomes a Boolean algebra
with constant values true and false where propositional va-
riables play the role of free (boolean) generators. This boolean
algebra flavor  together with the fact that equational logic
privileges the use of the equivalence ( ≡) connective instead
of the implication (⇒) connective (in contrast with Hilbert
and Gentzen style logical calculus) gives the E  calculus its
characteristic equational style.
With respect to predicate calculus, equational logic allows
more than one sort of variables interpreted in terms of standard
types such as the integers or the real numbers and even sets,
bags or sequences with elements of generic or such concrete
standard types.
Universal and existential quantifications are interpreted res-
pectively, as iterations of the conjunction and disjunction
operators. As you can see in table I, this view of quantification
is generalized to any associative and symmetric (commutative)
operator  with excellent advantages of unified notation and
instruction through their generalized axiomatic description.
The notation
(i | R.i : P.i)
denotes the iteration of operator  over the values of expres-
sion P.i for all values of  i satisfying the range-predicate R.i.
Bound variable i can be annotated with a type to indicate
the range of values it may assume. Actually, to deal with afalse range R.i it is necessary that operator  has an identity
in addition to the symmetry and associativity properties (for
instance, theorems and axioms involving false ranges in the
case of  corresponding to the operator ↑ in proposition 2, are
not applicable). Note that ∧ and ∨ are associative, symmetric
and have identities, so (∧x | 1 ≤x≤m : P.x) and (∨x | 1 ≤
x≤n : Q.x) make sense. The first is universal quantification,
more conventionally written as (∀x | 1 ≤ x ≤ m : P.x); the
second is existential quantification, (∃x | 1 ≤ x ≤ n : Q.x).
Observe that we write R.i to denote application of function
R to argument i.

The method to apply logic in this form, is described by
D. Gries and F. B. Schneider in their textbook ‘A Logical
Approach to Discrete Math’ [5]. As the authors explain, it
constitutes a revolutionary attempt, by using logic as a tool,
to change the way discrete math is taught. This approach has
the following advantages [7]:
• Equational logic is easy to teach, since the style is already
familiar to those who have had high-school algebra.
• Equational logic provides an alternative to reasoning in
native language. Rarely do proofs in equational logic pa-

rrot informal native languages arguments. Instead, proofs
are calculational, in that they are developed by calculating

are calculational, in that they are developed by calculating
using the rules of logic, much as one calculates to solve
a problem in high school algebra.
• Its principles and strategies can be used to help discover
theorems and proofs.
• The rigorous use of equational logic need not lead to
overwhelming complexity (as is the case with some lo-
gics). Typically, calculational proofs are shorter, simpler,
self-explanatory and easier to develop than argumentative
ones.
• Equational logic is versatile; it can be extended to a wide
variety of mathematical domains.
III.  TEACHING DISCRETE MATH THROUGH
CALCULATIONAL PROOFS
Our experience teaching discrete math using equational
logic has been extremely rewarding. Once our students have
completed a first course on logic and proof (including induc-
tion on a simple theory of sequences) with this approach, they
take a second course covering several subjects of discrete math
such as set theory (including some notions of relations and
functions), theory of integers, counting, and some relational
algebra (concluding with well founded relations and structural
induction, partial orders, lattices and boolean algebras).
Our students learn these subjects mainly proving theorems
and solving problems. We try to keep a balance between
uninterpreted manipulation of symbols (the strength of this
approach) and interpretation of mathematical expressions ac-
cording to their meaning. Theorems are considered both for
its importance and application as for the challenge to prove
them. Although all our proofs are done formally using the E 
calculus, we give equal importance to the comprehension of 
the meaning of the statement to be proved. Related ideas and
reflections about the statement to be proved help providing
insights about its truth, and hopefully, a plan to prove it.
The way we approach the subjects mentioned above goes
from concrete structures such as the integer numbers, finite
sets and sequences, as well as finite relations and functions
(represented in terms of sets of ordered pairs, boolean matrices
and simple encoding diagrams) to abstract theories such as
partial order relations, lattices and relational algebra.
In the process of getting familiar with this way of proving
theorems, it came as pleasant outcome the realization that
practically all these subjects become conceptually connected (a
feature unseen in the well known textbooks on discrete mathe-
matics) by the common lattice-theoretic properties underlying
their equational axioms and theorems. In fact, as we have
pointed out before, the equational calculus gives propositional
(as well as predicate) logic a treatment of boolean algebra.
It is also a well known fact (whose converse is the famous
Stone representation theorem [10]) that any collection of sets
closed under the usual union, intersection and complement
operations is a boolean algebra. The proof of the following
set theoretical proposition illustrates a well known connection
between the (extensionally defined) set-theoretical operations
and the corresponding propositional connectives considered as
boolean operators.
A ∪ (B ∩ C ) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C ) for all sets A,B and C .
Proof: It is enough to show that e ∈ A∪(B∩C ) ≡ e ∈
(A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C ) since the Extensionality axiom (defining
equality of sets) allows us to conclude the desired result.
e ∈ A ∪ (B ∩ C )
=  Definition of  ∪ 
e ∈ A ∨ e ∈ (B ∩ C )
=  Definition of  ∪ 
e ∈ A ∨ (e ∈ B ∧ e ∈ C )
=  Distribution of  ∨ over ∧ 
(e ∈ A ∨ e ∈ B) ∧ (e ∈ A ∨ e ∈ C )
=  Definition of  ∪ twice 
e ∈ A ∪ B ∧ e ∈ A ∪ C 
=  Definition of  ∩ 
e ∈ (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C )
Besides this more or less obvious connection, we can find
more of these connections both in set theory (considering the
inclusion relation instead of the membership relation) as well
as in the theory of integers through two interesting distributive
lattices: one associated with the usual linear order relation
of the integers together with the maximum and minimum
operators (↑ and ↓) and the other associated with divisibility
as an order relation, the greatest common divisor ( gcd ) and
the least common multiple ( lcm) operators (noted respectively
⇓ and ⇑).
The way this conceptual unification is established comes
from a couple of properties characterizing preorders (binary,
reflexive and transitive relations on a set) pointed out (with
proof) by Dijkstra [3] and applied by Feijen and Bijlsma [4]
to the maximum (↑) and minimum (↓) operators. The first one
is:
Theorem 2 (Indirect Inequality): If   is binary relation on
a set then the following propositions are equivalent:
(1)  is a preorder
(2) x  y ≡ (∀z | : z  x ⇒ z  y)
(3) x  y ≡ (∀z | : y  z ⇒ x  z)
Before proceeding with our explanation, we prove this theorem
in order to illustrate the way we use equational calculus.
Proof: We first prove (1) equivalent to (2).
To prove this, reflexivity and transitivity of   are shown
respectively equivalent to
(i) x  y ⇐ (∀z | : z  x ⇒ z  y) and
(ii) x  y ⇒ (∀z | : z  x ⇒ z  y)
We now show  reflexive equivalent to (i) by mutual impli-
cation:  reflexive implies (i):
(∀z | : z  x ⇒ z  y)
⇒  Instantiation with z := x 
x  x ⇒ x  y
=   is reflexive 
x  y
(i) implies  reflexive:
x  x
⇐  (i) with y := x 
