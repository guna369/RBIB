Abstract
The arterial lumen is modeled by a continuous right generalized cylinder with
piece-wise constant parameters. The method is based on the identification of
the parameters of each piece from a series of contours extracted along an
approximate axis of the artery. This curve is defined by a minimal path between
the artery end-points. The contours are extracted using the Fast Marching
algorithm. The identification of the axial parameters is based on a geometrical
analogy with helical curves, while the identification of the surface parameters
uses the Fourier series decomposition of the contours. Thus identified
parameters are used as observations in a Kalman optimal estimation scheme
that manages the spatial consistency from each piece to another. The method
was evaluated on 46 datasets from the MICCAI 3D Segmentation in the Clinic
Grand Challenge: Carotid Bifurcation Lumen Segmentation and Stenosis
Grading (http://cls2009.bigr.nl).

1 Introduction
Image segmentation plays an increasing role in today's assessment of
vascular diseases. Measurements inferred from the segmentation help
the physician to evaluate the disease severity. For example, one
important measure is the stenosis degree, indicating the percentage of
lumen reduction of a pathological section compared to the healthy part
of the vessel. Various approaches of vascular segmentation published
over the past years are mainly based on vessel tracking and deformable
models (see [6] for a review). Vessel tracking methods scan the vessel
incrementally and progressively build a discrete (geometrical)
representation of the vessel, usually composed by a centerline and a
stacking of planar contours. It is important to note that this approach
hardly exploits the 3D continuity of the vessel surface. On the other
hand, deformable models are usually discrete surfaces (meshes) that
deform their geometry to fit the data. The deformation is obtained by 
minimizing an objective function with two competitive terms: a local
constraint (data attachment) and a global constraint (a priori on the
geometrical shape). This approach does not provide direct access to
clinically useful cross-sectional measures.
This work is motivated by applications involving the segmentation and
the quantification of tubular-shaped objects, e.g. blood vessels, in
medical three-dimensional (3D) images. Although healthy blood-
vessels have cylindrical shapes with circular cross-sections,
pathologies such as atherosclerosis, may lead to quite complex
deformations of the cross-sectional shape.
A generalized cylinder model capable of representing complex
elongated objects, using a reduced number of parameters, was
proposed in [1]. The model is composed of two parts: the first one
describing the axial shape by means of orthonormal bases attached to
the axis, and the second one describing the surface by means of
contours in the planes orthogonal to the axis. This model was called
RGC-sm, which stands for right generalized cylinder state model,
since the authors used the system-state formalism. According to this
formalism, both components (the local base and the cross-sectional
contour) corresponding to any arc-length location, can be calculated
knowing only one initial base and contour, as well as their dynamics
(parameters describing their variation). The main characteristics of
RGC-sm are:
1. Piece-wise constant dynamics - the actual generalized cylinder is
subdivided into segments such that all the state variables within a 
segment are constants, and
80 Leonardo Flórez Valencia, Jacques Azencot, Maciej Orkisz
2. continuity - while continuously varying the arc-length, one obtains
a continuous axis and surface.
Asimilar model was recently used in [7].
In [3] we proposed an image-segmentation framework based on RGC-
sm, which makes use of the Kalman state estimator to determine the
optimal values of the state variables in the consecutive cylinder pieces.
The key point in this algorithm is an appropriate computation of
image-based observations. For each cylinder piece, these observations
are to be inferred from two contours extracted in the planes bounding
the piece. In this paper we assume that the contour-extraction problem
is resolved. The focus is a geometry-based reasoning that leads to the
retrieval of the observations to be used as input of the Kalman filter.
Thus, this paper is organized as follows: section 2 describes the RGC-
sm model, section 3 describes our vessel segmentation algorithm
based on RGC-sm and, finally, section 4 presents the results of
evaluating the method on 15 training and 31 testing datasets from the
MICCAI 3D Segmentation in the Clinic Grand Challenge: Carotid
Bifurcation Lumen Segmentation and Stenosis Grading
(http://cls2009.bigr.nl).
2 Right generalized cylinder model
The RGC-sm model is an association of a generating curve H and a
stack of contours describing the surfaceS (see figure 1).
The model is piece-wise, i.e. it assumes that a generalized cylinder can
be subdivided into pieces such that the model parameters be constant
within each piece separately. Each piece H of the generating curve isi
defined by its length ∆ , curvature Κ , torsion τ , and by the azimuthali i i
rotation angle , of the local basis Γ ,(t) attached to H , with respect toi i i
the corresponding Frenet frame (see figure 2).
Each piece S of the surface is a continuous stack of contours c (t,ω)i i
defined by a tuple{Z ,∆ ,}, whereZ ={Z  C; - q ≤ l ≤ + q} representsi i i i,l
the Fourier coefficients describing the first contour in the piece, and Λi
={λ  C; - q ≤ l ≤ + q} is an ordered set of 2 q + 1 coefficients linearlyi,l

Figure 4 shows the global flowchart of the proposed algorithm for
vascular segmentation. The vascular segment of interest is delimited by
two points interactively given by the user. The Kalman state estimator
(KSE) [8] (see section 3.1) is used to control the vessel tracking along an
approximate axis between these points (see section 3.3). It predicts the
3D locations, orientations and shapes of the contours that delimit the
consecutive cylinder pieces. The observation vector, coding the RGC-
sm parameters of the i -th piece (see section 3.2), is computed from the
result of the contour extraction performed in the predicted plane (see
section 3.4). The observation is then filtered by the KSE to produce a
corrected estimate of the parameters, which is expected to smooth out
the possible errors of the contours and initial axis extraction. Only the
very first contour remains uncorrected.
The KSE adapts the tracking speed to the complexity of the local
vascular shapes (axial and superficial). In complex shapes (high local
changes of curvature, for example) the length of the cylinder piece is
automatically reduced. This occurs when the predicted contours are too
different from the observations.
3.1 Kalman stateestimator
The KSE, [8], addresses the general problem of estimation of the x -
xdimensional state x R of a discrete-time controlled process that is
governed by the linear stochastic difference equation:

where the random variables w and v represent, respectively, thei i
process and measurement noises. These noises are assumed to be
statistically independent between them, white and with normal
probability distributions:

where Q and R are the respective covariance matrices.
The xx x matrix A in equation 4 relates the state at the previous step i - 1
to the state at the current step i , in the absence of either a driving
function or process noise. The x x u matrix B relates the optional u -

measurement equation 5 relates the state to the measurement m .
The KSE algorithm is basically a loop that updates the ``time'' i by
^ ^ -projecting (predicting) the previous estimated state X to X andi-1 i
then correcting this prediction using the current measurement m to

obtain the newly estimated (innovated) state X . Furthermore, a
measure of the error estimation of the process is kept in the x x x
matrices P . The pseudo-code of the KSE is written in algorithm 1:i
the
^
initialization vector X , the process noise vector P , the time-depending0 0
input vector u and measurement vector m . Furthermore, a stop criteriai i
has to be defined in order to terminate the prediction-innovation loop.
These definitions are discussed in the next section.
3.1.1 Kalman equations for vessel tracking and RGC
construction
The matrices and vectors used in our KSE-based vessel tracking
algorithm are:
The measurement vector m  contains the information needed to 
construct the vector defined in equation 3.
Algorithm 1: Kalman state estimator basic algorithm as presented in [12].
The key to use a KSE is the definition of the matrices A, B, H, Q, R,
85Carotid arteries segmentation in CT images with use of a right generalized cylinder model
The state vector x contains the information needed to construct the
vector defined in equation 3, together with its velocity (x  [M
TM´] ). In other words, it also describes RGC-sm pieces with the rate
of change of each RGC-sm parameter.

i.e. predicted pieces are just projections of

H = I : i.e. measured pieces, in the absence of noise, should be

After each iteration, the estimated state is appended to the resulting
RGC-sm, thus constructing the final cylindrical representation of the
chosen vessel.
3.2 Retrievalofobservations from imagedata
Without loss of generality, we explain the process for the first cylinder
piece. Under the assumption of constant curvature and torsion, each
piece ofH is a helix, and a geometrical reasoning demonstrates that its
parameters can be recovered if the frames Γ Γ at its extremities, as0 , 1
well as their origin locations h and h , are available. Owing to a lack of
0 1
space here, this reasoning will be given in a future publication. The
remaining parameters are calculated using the Fourier decompositions 
of the contoursZ andZ . We first give main equations that lead from Γ0 1 0
Γ , h , h ,Z andZ to the RGC-sm parameters. Then we explain the1 0 1 0 1
image processing steps that lead from the initial image and seed-points
to these intermediate data.
3.2.1 Calculation ofmodelparameters
We first compute the transition operators, respectively rotation and
translation, between the extremities:

Φ is a rotation operator and one of the properties of the rotation matrices
Tis the existence of Θ and Ξ such that Φ ( 0, ∆ ) - Φ ( 0, ∆ ) = 2 sin Θ.Ξ ,0 0
where Θ is the rotation angle and the non-zero elements of the
antisymmetric matrix Ξ compose the vector defining the rotation axis. 
Moreover, it can be demonstrated that Φ (t , t ) = exp ((t - t ). Ψ), where1 2 2 1
Ψ is proportional to Ξ : Ψ = µΞ. In the case where Φ describes the
rotation between two frames attached to a helix, the coefficient µ is also
involved in the calculation of the curvature and torsion of the helix.
Indeed, these are proportional (via µ ) to the cosine and sine of the angle
ϕ that represents the “slope”' of the helix. Hence, the second step is the
subtraction:
Numerical stability problems might arise when Φ ( 0, ∆ ) = I, which0
It can be demonstrated that a, b, c can be used to calculate ϕ, then µ:
which in turn permits the computation of the axial parameters:

3.3 Approximateaxial shapeextraction
As mentioned above, in the current implementation, the vessel tracking
with Kalman estimation of RGC-sm parameters is performed along an
~ ~
initial approximate axis H. The line H, that coarsely describes the
axial shape of the vessel, is constructed as follows:
11. A binary image B (p), is computed from the initial image f (p),
using locally adaptive thresholds f , f that coarsely separate theL H
vascular lumen from the background. These thresholds are defined
using the results presented in [4]. According to that work, the
vascular lumen intensities along the carotids have two properties:
(a) the global lower threshold values are in the range [140HU,
420HU], and (b) the local threshold values vary almost linearly
along the vessel axis. Using these properties, the lumen is
segmented using a flooding algorithm that computes thresholds
depending on the distance of each voxel to user-given seeds. The
local threshold properties are computed using the RobustAutomatic
Threshold Selection (RATS) scheme [9].
2. An Euclidean distance map E(p), is computed within B(p) using
the algorithm proposed in [10].
3. Finally, a cost function F(p) = is used for a minimal path
~algorithm (as proposed in [13]), which finds a set H of points
ordered along the shape and connecting the seed-points even in the
presence of lumen discontinuities (severe stenoses). These points
are expected to be located near the center of the vessel due to the cost
functionF(p), related to the distance mapE (p)
3.4 Contoursextraction
The planar contours are extracted using the fast marching (FM) method
[11]. FM is a front propagation technique that provides a set of (counter-
clockwise) ordered points C = {c : 0 ≤ k < K}. This technique needsi i, k

the definition of a potential field P(p) expected to be maximum at
discontinuities (edges) and minimum within uniform regions. We use
the potentials proposed in [2], where the native image intensities f (p)
along with image discontinuities represented by the gradient magnitude
  f (p) are used:

The functionK (.) of a scalar µ is defined as follows:

where α is a shift, β is a signed sharpness parameter and d (p) is a mono-
dimensional derivative of |  f (p)| along the direction normal to the
front. With α =0, α = f , α = f , β = 100 , β = 1 and β = -1 , this1 2 1 3 H 1 2 3
potential function P strongly decreases the propagation speed when the
front moves beyond local maxima of the gradient norm (i.e. beyond
borders of the arteries) or beyond the range [ f , f ] of luminal intensities,1 1
defined as described in previous subsection. Furthermore, in this work
the authors recommend that the FM propagation should be stopped at
time value T when the growth of the area A encompassed by the front
becomes very slow, which is characterized by a large value of ∆T/∆A .
Actually, at each iteration we compute the mean m and the standardT/A
deviation σ of ∆T/∆A and the propagation stops when ∆T/∆A> m +T/A T/A
10 σ . All the coefficient settings correspond to the experimentalT/A
values from [2].
Front propagation is performed in the plane passing through the
~^
predicted point h  H , and oriented according to the predicted vesseli

point setC is extracted as follows:i

4 Results
Both lumen segmentation and stenosis quantification were evaluated on
15 training and 31 testing carotid CTA datasets available within the
Carotid Bifurcation Algorithm Evaluation Framework. Details of the
evaluation methodology can be found on the web page of the challenge
[5]. Figure 5 displays an example of segmentation result.

Stenosis quantification was evaluated by calculating the difference
between the calculated percentage and the one provided by the
reference standard, using both cross-sectional areas and diameters. The
results are presented in table 1.
Four criteria were evaluated to assess the lumen segmentation: Dice
similarity index, mean surface distance, RMS surface distance and
maximal surface distance. Table 2 summarizes the results obtained.
The average running time of our algorithm, including lumen
segmentation, stenosis grading and display of intermediate and final
results, was 3.7 ∠1.3 minutos.

5 Discussion and conclusion
RGC-sm is a powerful tool that permits a concise description of
complex generalized cylindrical shapes. The theoretical framework
permits the reconstruction of a continuous surface corresponding to the
lumen, based on a limited number of discrete contours.Additionally, the
Kalman estimator permits a correction of the observation errors when
these remain within a reasonable range. However, our current
implementation of the image processing steps devised to provide the
observations is clearly not optimal. The initial rough extraction of the
axial shape begins by a thresholding step, which is prone to errors when
neighboring structures have a similar intensity range. Actually, this
initial curve needs to be quite well-centered within the lumen. Indeed, as
the Fast Marching algorithm in planes orthogonal to this initial curve

Carotid arteries segmentation in CT images with use of a right generalized cylinder model
starts from the intersection between the plane and the curve, this
intersection has to fall within the lumen, otherwise the contour
extraction fails. Failures are also observed when the curve is located
within the lumen, close to a poorly contrasted boundary. In fact, the use
of an always inflating deformable contour, such as the Fast Marching
front, is uneasy, since the speed function and stopping criteria hardly can
cope with all possible configurations (nearby veins, calcifications, etc.).
Furthermore, 2D Fast Marching does not exploit the 3D continuity of
the vascular lumen, which might be helpful in some complicated
situations. Future work will be oriented towards an implementation that
do not require the initial extraction of an approximate axial shape and
that perform a piece-wise local 3D boundary extraction. Let us also note
that the current implementation was designed with an implicit
assumption (constraint) that the seed-points are also end-points, and are
given at "easy" locations, i.e. healthy circular cross-sections without
neighboring structures "stuck" to the artery of interest. Hence, the
method had difficulties in datasets where the seed-point in the internal 
carotid artery was located either close to the bifurcation, so that our
method segmented a too short part of the artery, or near the skull where
the assumption of the absence of neighboring structures did not hold.
Further work is necessary to cope with seed-points located anywhere
within the vessel of interest.
