Abstract
We present a new criterion for conuence of (possibly) non-terminating left-
linear term rewriting systems. The criterion is based on certain strong joinabil-
ity properties of parallel critical pairs . We show how this criterion relates to
other well-known results, consider some special cases and discuss some possible
extensions.
1 Introduction and Overview
Computation formalisms which are based on rewriting systems heavily rely on the
fundamental properties of termination and conuence. For terminating and conuent
systems normal forms exist and are unique, irrespective of the computation (rewriting)
strategy. For non-terminating but conuent systems, normal forms need not exist,
however, if a normal form exists, it is still unique. More generally, any (possibly in-
nite) diverging computations can be joined again. In some cases, non-termination
is inherently unavoidable, in other cases it may be very dicult to verify this prop-
erty. Hence the problem of proving conuence (with or without termination) is of
fundamental importance.
For abstract reduction (or abstract rewriting) systems (ARSs for short) it is well-known
that, under termination, conuence is equivalent to local conuence, via Newman's
Lemma. For proving conuence of non-terminating ARSs, however, one usually needs
much stronger local conuence properties. A very interesting unifying framework,
based on so-called decreasing diagrams, for localizing conuence proofs (even without

termination) in the general setting of labelled abstract rewriting systems has recently
been developed by van Oostrom ([Oos94a]).
For term rewriting systems (TRSs for short), which are ARSs with some additional
structure, local conuence can be characterized by conuence of critical pairs as ex-
pressed by the well-known Critical Pair Lemma. Hence, for (nite) terminating TRSs,
this critical pair test yields decidability of conuence.
For non-terminating TRSs, however, the situation is much more dicult again. Even
the absence of critical pairs does not guarantee conuence, as there exist non-termina-
ting, non-overlapping TRSs which are (locally conuent but) not conuent (cf. e.g.
[Hue80]). These counterexamples must necessarily be non-left-linear.
1
In fact, TRSs
which are left-linear and non-overlapping, i.e., orthogonal , are conuent (cf. e.g. [Ros73]).
This fundamentally important positive result has been considerably generalized by
Huet ([Hue80]) and further by Toyama ([Toy88]) by allowing critical pairs, but impos-
ing certain strong joinability properties on them (cf. Theorems 3.2, 3.5 and 3.7 below).
The rst result, Theorem 3.2, however, has the severe drawback that it addition-
ally requires right-linearity, a `rather unnatural condition' as pointed out in [Hue80].
Theorems 3.5 and 3.7 of Huet/Toyama are particularly interesting, since they do not
require right-linearity. They are proved by showing strong conuence of parallel reduc-
tion, making essential use of the above mentioned particular joinability properties of
(ordinary) critical pairs.
Our main new (and quite natural) idea now is that in order to ensure strong conuence
of parallel reduction, one may also dene and investigate the corresponding notion of
parallel critical pairs. This new concept indeed turns out to be very useful, since we
are able to state and prove a new sucient condition for strong conuence of parallel
reduction (cf. Theorem 4.11) which is based on certain joinability properties for parallel
critical pairs (cf. Denition 4.8).
Actually, the idea behind parallel critical pairs is not completely new. Implicitly,
parallel critical pairs { or, more precisely, parallel critical peaks { are at the heart of
so-called critical pair criteria for completion of terminating TRSs (cf. [WB86], [Kuc85],
[KMN88], [BD88]), where certain (ordinary) critical pairs can be ignored during com-
pletion since they are redundant.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. After introducing the necessary ter-
minology, we present in Section 3 the known related results, give an example where
none of the known conuence criteria applies, and motivate the introduction of parallel
critical pairs. The main result of the paper, Theorem 4.11, is proved in Section 4. Its
relation to the previous results, various illuminating examples and other related work
are discussed in Section 5. Finally we conclude by discussing directions for further
extending and generalizing our approach.

Some interesting eorts for isolating the essence of the source of non-conuence in this case are
described e.g. in [OT94], [TO95]. A decidable sucient (syntactic) condition for conuence of non-
left-linear, non-terminating TRSs is given in [TO95].

2 Preliminaries
We assume familiarity with the basic theory of abstract reduction systems as well as of
the special case of term rewriting systems. For comprehensive surveys see e.g. [Klo92],
[DJ90], [AM90], [Pla94]. Furthermore we also use some basic facts about unication
theory (cf. e.g. [BS94] for a recent survey).
2.1 Abstract Reduction Systems
An abstract reduction system (ARS) is a pair A = hA;!i consisting of a (base) set A
and a binary relation ! AA also called (abstract) reduction or (abstract) rewrite
relation. We use the standard notations !
+
, !

, !
=
(or !
1
) for the transitive,
transitive-reexive and reexive closure, respectively, of !. The notations for the
inverse relations are obtained by `mirroring', e.g., we use  for the inverse of !.
Relation composition is denoted by . Two elements a; b 2 A are said to be joinable
(denoted by a # b) if there exists c 2 A : a!

c

 b. If a!

b, we call b a reduct of
a. The identity relation on A is given by id
A
= f(a; a) j a 2 Ag.
Denition 2.1 (conuence properties)
Let A = hA;!i be an ARS. Then A (or !)
 is conuent (CONF) if

  !

!



 .
 is Church-Rosser (CR) if $

!



 .
 is locally conuent or weakly Church-Rosser (WCR) if   !  !



 .
 is strongly conuent (SCR) if  !  !


=
 .
 is subcommutative (WCR
1
) if  !  !
=

=
 .
 is uniformly conuent (WCR
1
) if   ! id
A
[ (!   ).
 has the diamond property (3) if   ! !   .
Note that if the reduction relation ! of A = hA;!i is reexive, then the diamond
property, subcommutativity and uniform conuence (of A) are equivalent.
Conuence of an ARS A = hA;!i can be characterized in various equivalent ways.
For instance, we have:
CR(!) () CONF(!) () CR(!

) ()   !

!



 :
Justied by the equivalence of the rst two properties above and following a widespread
convention we shall subsequently denote the conuence property by CR.
We note that due to the equivalence CR(!) () CR(!

) (by idempotence of 

),
for proving conuence of ! it suces to prove conuence of  for some reduction
relation  with the same transitive-reexive closure, i.e. with  

=!

.

The next well-known result summarizes the relationships between the various conu-
ence properties introduced in Denition 2.1 above. It provides interesting sucient
criteria for proving conuence by strengthened versions of local conuence.
Theorem 2.2 (conuence by strengthening local conuence)
Let A = hA;!i be an ARS. Then the following implications hold:
3 =)WCR
1
=)WCR
1
=) SCR =) CR :
Local conuence (WCR) does not imply conuence (CR) in general, but only under the
additional assumption of termination. This fundamentally important result, known as
Newman's Lemma, is at the heart of many conuence proofs in the literature.
Here, an ARS A = hA;!i (or !) is said to be terminating if there exists no innite
reduction sequence a
0
! a
1
! a
2
! : : : (of elements of A). A (or!) is called complete
(or convergent) if it is conuent and terminating.
Theorem 2.3 (Newman's Lemma, [New42])
A terminating ARS A = hA;!i is conuent if and only if it is locally conuent.
2.2 Term Rewriting Systems
A term rewriting system R (over some set T (F ;V) of terms) may be viewed as the
ARS hT (F ;V);!
R
i where !
R
or simply ! is the rewrite relation induced by the
rewrite rules l ! r 2 R (l; r 2 T (F ;V) with V ar(r)  V ar(l)). A term is linear if no
variable occurs more than once in it. A rewrite rule l ! r is said to be left-linear /
right-linear if l / r is linear. A TRS is left-linear / right-linear if all its rules are
left-linear / right-linear.
For substitutions we use prex notation, sometimes omitting parentheses, e.g., we write
(s) or s to denote the result of applying the substitution  to the term s. The domain
and the variable range of a substitution  are denoted by Dom() (or Dom ) and
VRan() (or VRan ), respectively.
Positions (of terms) are also dened as usual, and denoted by p, q etc.. They are
ordered by  as usual. The `empty' root position is denoted by . Concatenation of
positions is denoted by juxtaposition. If p  q we say that p is above q (or q is below
p). For subtracting positions we use n, i.e., we write pn q = q
0
if p = qq
0
. Two positions
p and q are said to be parallel (or independent, disjoint), denoted by p k q, if neither
p  q nor q  p. These notations extend in a straightforward way to sets of positions.
The set of positions of a term s is denoted by Pos(s). The sets of variable positions
and of non-variable, i.e., function symbol, positions of s are denoted by VPos(s) and
FPos(s), respectively. The subterm of s at some position p 2 Pos(s) is denoted by
s=p. In order to indicate that t is the subterm of s at position p 2 Pos(s), we also write
s = s[p = t]. The result of replacing in s the subterm at position p 2 Pos(s) by t is
denoted by s[p t]. The result of (simultaneously) replacing in s the subterms at some
set P = fp
1
; : : : ; p
n
g  Pos(s) of parallel positions (of s) by t
1
; : : : ; t
n
, respectively, is
4
denoted by s[p
1
 t
1
] : : : [p
n
 t
n
] (where the order of the replacement is irrelevant)
or simply s[p
i
 t
i
j 1  i  n]. Similarly, s[p
i
= t
i
j 1  i  n] denotes s indicating
additionally that s=p
i
= t
i
for all i, 1  i  n.
If a term s rewrites to t at position p 2 Pos(s) using rule l ! r and substitution ,
i.e., s=p = l, t = s[p  r], this is indicated by using the notation s !
p;;l!r
t or,
when ignoring the applied rule and used substitution but keeping the position of the
contracted (i.e., replaced) redex (i.e., reducible expression), by s !
p
t. Furthermore,
we write s!
p
t if s reduces (in one step) to t by contracting some redex (in s) below
p 2 Pos(s), and similarly for s!
p
t.
A unication problem is a (nite) set (or multiset) of equations to be solved. Here
we use
:
= in order distinguish e.g. the singleton unication problem s
:
= t from the
(syntactic) equality s = t (cf. [BS94] for further details).
For testing local conuence of TRSs the following notion originating from [KB70] is
fundamental.
Denition 2.4 (critical pairs)
Let R be a TRS and let l ! r, l
0
! r
0
be two rules of R that w.l.o.g. do not have any
common variable.
2
Suppose l=p, with p 2 FPos(l), and l
0
are uniable with mgu ,
where VRan()\(V ar(l)nV ar(l=p)) = ;.
3
Then the pair of reducts h(l)[p r
0
]; ri
is called a critical pair of R, determined by overlapping l
0
! r
0
into l ! r at position
p. The divergence (l)[p  r
0
]
p
 l !

r is the corresponding critical peak . If
p = , we speak of an outside critical peak (or critical overlay)and outside critical pair ,
respectively. Otherwise, i.e., if p > , we speak of an inside critical peak and inside
critical pair , respectively (following [Toy88]). If the two rules are renamed versions of
the same rule we do not consider the case p =  (which gives only rise to improper
divergences). The set of all critical pairs between rules of R is denoted by CP(R).
If CP(R) = ;, R is said to be non-overlapping. It is called orthogonal if it is non-
overlapping and left-linear.
Observe the asymmetry in the denition of critical pairs. This entails in particular,
that for a critical overlay t
1 
 s!

t
2
we always get two corresponding critical pairs,
namely ht
1
; t
2
i and ht
2
; t
1
i. Moreover we note, that a critical pair may correspond
to (i.e., be obtained from) several distinct critical peaks (if taking into account the
position of the inside rewrite step and the applied rules).
4
Lemma 2.5 (Critical Pair Lemma, [Hue80])
A TRS is locally conuent if and only if all its critical pairs are joinable.
Combining Newman's Lemma and the Critical Pair Lemma yields the following fun-
damental result.
2
Note that considering renamed versions of the same rule of R is allowed here, too.
3
This variable condition ensures that the mgu  does not introduce unnecessary identications of
variables in l. In case that the mgu of t = l=p and l
0
is taken such that no new variables are introduced
(which is always possible), this condition is vacuously satied.
4
For the sake of readability we dispense here with a completely formal denition of critical peaks
which is straightforward.
5
Theorem 2.6 ([KB70])
A terminating TRS is conuent (hence complete) if and only if all its critical pairs are
joinable.
3 Known Results and Motivating Examples
Without termination, showing conuence of a TRS is much more dicult. For left-
linear systems, a few results relying on strong conuence properties are known.
Denition 3.1 (strongly closed, [Hue80])
A TRS R is called strongly closed , which we denote by SCCP(R),
5
if for every critical
pair ht
1
; t
2
i there exist terms t
3
, t
4
such that t
1
!

t

=
 t
2
and t

!
=
t


 t
2
.
Theorem 3.2 (strong conuence by strong closedness, [Hue80])
A left- and right-linear strongly closed TRS is strongly conuent, hence also conuent.
Proof: The proof in [Hue80] is by a complete case analysis for one-step divergences
of the form t
1
 s ! t
2
exploiting strong closedness for the case that t
1
 s ! t
2
corresponds to an instance of a critical peak (note that right-linearity is needed for the
case of a variable overlap).
The following very nice counterexample shows that right-linearity cannot be dropped
in Theorem 3.2.

g(b

x)! g(x; x)
g(x; b
0
)! g(x; x)
is left-linear, non-right-linear and non-terminating. Moreover, it is easily veried that
R is strongly closed, but non-conuent. In fact, we have e.g. f(a
0
; a
0
)

 f(a; a) !

g(b
0
; b
0
) but f(a
0
; a
0
) and g(b
0
; b
0
) do not have a common reduct (cf. Figure 1).
For left-linear, but not necessarily right-linear TRSs one may use the following approach
of Huet ([Hue80]). Let R be a TRS. Then the parallel reduction relation (induced by
R),   k!
R
or simply   k!, is dened as the smallest reexive relation containing! and

A TRS R is called parallel closed if for every critical pair ht

Theorem 3.5 (subcommutativity of parallel reduction by parallel closed-
ness, [Hue80])
If R is a left-linear parallel closed TRS, then parallel reduction (in R) is subcommu-
tative (WCR

Toyama ([Toy88]) observed that, in Theorem 3.5 above, the condition that all critical
pairs are parallel closed can be weakened without losing strong conuence of parallel
reduction.

The conditions (i)-(ii) of Denition 3.6 are depicted in Figure 2 (dashed arrows in
diagrams are existentially quantied).
Theorem 3.7 (strong conuence of parallel reduction, [Toy88]
8
)
If R is a left-linear TRS satisfying the critical pair condition CPC
HT
, then parallel
reduction (in R) is strongly conuent (SCR(  k!)), hence R is conuent.
Proof: The proof in [Toy88] essentially proceeds as the one of [Hue80] for Theorem
3.5 above. One shows strong conuence of parallel reduction by considering parallel

In fact, the corresponding result in [Toy88], Corollary 3.2, p. 405, is obtained there by specializing
a more general version, namely Theorem 3.1, p. 401, formulated in terms of a sucient condition for
commutativity of two left-linear TRSs.

sizes of those `P - and Q-redexes' which are aected in both steps ignoring, however,
overlaying redexes.
Before proceeding let us elaborate a bit on variations of critical pair conditions for
ensuring conuence of left-linear TRSs. Huet's result above states that
(1) s  k!t for every critical pair hs; ti of R
suces for ensuring conuence. Surprisingly, it still seems to be unknown whether any
of the following conditions also suces (see [DJK91], Problem 13 of J.-J. Levy).
(2) s  k!t or t  k!s, for every critical pair hs; ti of R.
(3) s!
=
t or t!
=
s, for every critical pair hs; ti of R.
(4) t  k!s for every critical pair hs; ti of R.
(5) t!
=
s for every critical pair hs; ti of R.
Clearly, the following implications hold between these conditions: (5) =) (3) =) (2),
(5) =) (4) =) (2). We remark that due to Theorem 3.2 potential counterexamples
for (3) and (5) would have to be (besides left-linear) non-right-linear, non-terminating
and non-orthogonal, hence overlapping. Unfortunately, our approach developed below
does not solve any of these open problems.
For motivating our approach to showing conuence via strong conuence of parallel
reduction let us now consider the following modied version of Levy's counterexample
3.3 above.

non-right-linearity of R, though R is strongly closed. Nevertheless, parallel reduction
(in R) is strongly conuent (as will be shown). For instance, we observe that the
divergence f(a

could only be closed via g(b; b)! f(a; a)  k!f(a

no term t with f(a

the parallel step f(a; a)  k!f(a

which are critical w.r.t. the other outside step.

Intuitively, the observations above suggest to analyse more carefully local divergences
where in one parallel step several (parallel) redex positions are critical w.r.t. the other
step. From a more abstract point of view this means to study the following questions:
(1) What are critical peaks / pairs for the parallel reduction relation?
(2) Which conditions on the corresponding critical peaks / pairs for parallel reduction
guarantee strong conuence?
For (1) we shall introduce the notion of parallel critical peaks / pairs. In fact, Denition
4.1 below only accounts for critical divergences of the form t
1
 k   s!

t
2
. However,
this type of divergences (for parallel reduction) will turn out to be sucient for char-
acterizing strong conuence of   k! (cf. Lemma 4.9 below). Concerning (2) we shall
present a parallel critical pair condition (cf. Denition 4.8) which indeed suces for
guaranteing strong conuence of   k! (cf. Theorem 4.11).
4 Main Result
Denition 4.1 (parallel critical pairs / peaks)
Let R be a TRS and let l! r, l
1
! r

, : : : , l
n
! r
n
be rules of R that w.l.o.g. do not
have any common variable. Suppose P = fp
1
; : : : ; p
n
g is a non-empty set of parallel
non-variable positions of l. Suppose further that the unication problem fl
i
:
= l=p
i
j 1 
i  ng is solvable, let's say with mgu , where VRan()\(V ar(l)n(
S
n

V ar(l=p
i
))) =
;. Then the pair of reducts h(l)[p
i
 r
i
j 1  i  n]; ri is called a parallel critical
pair of R, determined by overlapping (in parallel) the rules l
i
! r
i
into l ! r at the
(parallel) positions p
i
(of l). The divergence (l)[p
i
 r
i
j 1  i  n]
P
 k   l!

r is
the corresponding parallel critical peak . If n = 1 and l ! r, l
1
! r
1
are two renamed
versions of the same rules, we do not consider the case p =  (which gives only rise
to improper divergences). The set of all parallel critical pairs between rules of R is
denoted by PCP(R). A parallel critical peak (and its corresponding parallel critical
10
pair) is said to be proper if the inside parallel step in it contracts more than one redex
(with the notation from above: n  2).
Denition 4.2 (recursive computation of parallel critical pairs)
Let R be a TRS. We recursively dene the sets PCP
k
(R) of parallel critical pairs of
order k by:
 PCP
1
(R) := CP(R), i.e., the parallel critical pairs (and peaks, respectively) of
order 1 are the ordinary critical pairs (and peaks, respectively) of R.
 PCP

(R) (for k  1) is obtained from PCP
k
(R) as follows: Let t

FPos(l) with p

Let l

be a rule from R with fresh variables such that (l=p

are uniable with mgu  , where VRan( )\(V ar(t

critical pairs of order k + 1 (with corresponding parallel critical peaks of order
k + 1).

Remark 4.3 If in the above denition the size of the left hand sides of R is bounded,
then there is a maximal k for which PCP
k
(R) may properly contribute to PCP
rec
(R).
This is obvious, since for constructing a parallel critical peak of order k we need at least
k function symbols occurring at k parallel (non-variable) positions in some left hand
side of R. Hence, for any m  max

Lemma 4.4 For any TRS R the sets PCP(R) and PCP
rec

able renamings).

Proof: Straightforward, by standard rewriting (and unication) techniques. One
only has to use the basic fact, that solving a given unication problem E [fs
:
= tg can
be recursively done by rst solving E yielding (in case of solvability) a most general
unier  (via a solved form of E), and then solving additionally s
:
= t producing
(in case of solvability) let's say the mgu  . Then, the composition of  and  ,    ,
is an mgu of the original unication problem E [ fs
:
= tg.
In order to get some intuition for the introduced notion of parallel critical pairs / peaks
and their computation let us give two simple examples.
Example 4.5 The TRS
R =

:
f(g(x); h(x; y))! a
g(b)! c
h(x; d)! e
has two (parallel) critical peaks of order 1, namely f(c; h(b; y))
1
 f(g(b); h(b; y))!

a
and f(g(x); e)
2
 f(g(x); h(x; d)) !

a, obtained by overlapping the second and the
third rule, respectively, into the rst one. And there is one (proper) parallel critical
peak of order 2, namely f(c; e)
f1;2g
 k   f(g(b); h(b; d)) !

a, obtained either directly
by overlapping in parallel the last two rules into the rst, or recursively from both
critical peaks of order 1 by an additional superposition. Hence, we have PCP
1
(R) =
fhf(c; h(b; y)); ai; hf(g(x); e); aig, PCP
2
(R) = fhf(c; e); aig, and PCP(R) = PCP
1
(R)[
PCP
2
(R).
Example 4.6 The TRS
R =
8
>
<

:
f(g(x); h(x))! a
g(b)! d
h(c)! d
has two (parallel) critical peaks of order 1, namely f(d; h(b))
1
 f(g(b); h(b)) !

a
and f(g(c); d)
2
 f(g(c); h(c))!

a, obtained by overlapping the second and the third
rule, respectively, into the rst one. However, there is no (proper) parallel critical peak
of order 2, since simultaneously unifying g(x) with g(b) and h(x) with h(c) obviously
fails. Hence, we get PCP(R) = PCP
1
(R) = fhf(d; h(b)); ai; hf(g(c); d); aig.

Proof: Routine, by a straightforward peak analysis analogous to the situation for

Next we introduce the central condition on parallel critical pairs that will enable us to
prove strong conuence of parallel reduction.

Lemma 4.9 (characterizing strong conuence of parallel reduction)
For a given TRS, parallel reduction is strongly conuent if and only if for all terms s, t

t

we have: whenever t

Proof: The direction `=)' is obvious by denition of strong conuence and the facts
!   k!, !



. Conversely, supposing (1)  k    !!

 k   , we have to
show (2)  k     k!    k!

 k   (note that   k! =   k!

In fact, Lemma 4.9 can also be obtained as a special case from the following easy results
about abstract reduction relations.

tions)
Let !

. Hence, Lemma 4.9 follows by properties (1)
and (2) of Lemma 4.10 above.
Now we are prepared for the main result of the paper.
Theorem 4.11 (strong conuence of parallel reduction via parallel critical
pairs)
If a left-linear TRS R satises the parallel critical pair condition PCPC, then parallel
reduction (in R) is strongly conuent (more succinctly: PCPC(R) =) SCR(  k!)),
and hence, (ordinary reduction ! in) R is also conuent.
Proof: Let R be a left-linear TRS satisfying PCPC(R). According to Lemma 4.9 it
suces to show that whenever we have a local divergence of the form
D : t
1
 k   s! t
2
;
there exists a term t
3
such that
t

!

t

Hence, suppose s reduces to t
1
by contracting n parallel redexes s=p

using the rules l

! r

; : : : ; l

may assume that the set P = fp

g of parallel redex positions is non-empty, i.e.,
n  1 (the case n = 0 is trivial!). Further, suppose that s reduces to t
2
by contracting
some redex s=q in s using some rule l! r of R with substitution .
We proceed by a complete case distinction according to the relative positions of the
contracted redexes (at p
1
; : : : ; p
n
; q in s) in D (this case analysis is illustrated in Fig. 5
below).

independent steps and by combining twice two independent parallel steps into one

of the parallel step rst, and then tackle the remaining `parallel peak' by using

Since non-overlapping TRSs have no critical pairs, hence also no parallel critical pairs,
we obtain as a direct consequence of Theorem 4.11 the following well-known result.
Corollary 4.12 (cf. e.g. [Ros73])
Any orthogonal TRS is conuent.

For readers which are familiar with the proof of Huet/Toyama for Theorem 3.7 we re-
mark that one crucial dierence between their proof (of Theorem 3.7) and ours (of The-
orem 4.11) is the following. In the case that the considered local divergence t

has the form t

where at least one of the positions p 2 P is critical
w.r.t. the outside step, i.e., p 2 FPos(l), the proof of Huet/Toyama appeals to the
induction hypothesis, whereas we proceed as described, namely by exploiting case (iii)
of the parallel critical pair condition PCPC(R). Interestingly, these two approaches
seem to be incompatible, as the examples below suggest.
5 Discussion and Related Work
We give (non-terminating) examples showing that the presented conuence criteria
SCCP, CPC
HT
and PCPC are not comparable with each other. In fact, for the former
two this is well-known.
Example 5.1 (Example 3.8 continued, left-linear case: PCPC ; CPC
HT
)
In this example it is easily veried that PCPC(R) is indeed satised. In particular, for
the (proper) parallel critical peak f(a
0
; a
0
) k   f(a; a)!

b we have f(a
0
; a
0
)! b, hence
f(a
0
; a
0
)!

b as desired. However, CPC
HT
is not applicable, since e.g. the inside critical
peak f(a
0
; a)  f(a; a) !

b is not parallel closed, i.e., we do not have f(a
0
; a)  k!b.
Moreover, the strongly closed criterion SCCP is also not applicable, because R is not
right-linear.
Example 5.2 (left- and right-linear case: PCPC ; CPC
HT
;SCCP)
The TRS
R =
8

>
>
>
<
>
>
>
>
:
f(a)! f(g(b; b))
a! g(c; c)
c! d
d! b
b! d
is left- and right-linear (and non-terminating). Moreover, it is easily checked that R
satises PCPC(R), but neither CPC
HT
(R) nor SCCP(R).
Example 5.3 (left- and right-linear case: SCCP ; PCPC)
The TRS
R =
8

:
f(a; b)! c
a! a
0
b! b
0
c! f(a
0
; b)
c! f(a; b
0
)
c! f(a; b)
is left- and right-linear (and non-terminating). Furthermore, as it is easy to check,
we have SCCP(R) but neither CPC
HT
(R) nor PCPC(R). This means that R is
strongly conuent. Note, however, that parallel reduction is only conuent here, but
not strongly conuent.
17
Example 5.4 (left-linear case: CPC
HT
; PCPC)
The TRS
R =
8
>
>
<
>
>
:
f(a; a)! g(f(a; a))
a! b
f(b; x)! g(f(x; x))
f(x; b)! g(f(x; x))
is left-linear (and non-terminating). Furthermore, it is obviously parallel closed, i.e.,
CPC
HT
(R) holds. However, it doesn't satisfy the parallel critical pair condition
PCPC(R) (because the proper parallel critical pair hf(b; b); g(f(a; a))i is not joinable
from left to right, i.e., f(b; b)!

g(f(a; a)) does not hold).
The last example shows in particular, that CPC
HT
is not subsumed in general by PCPC.
However, there is one special case where CPC
HT
is indeed (properly) subsumed by
PCPC, namely when there are no proper parallel critical pairs (but only ordinary inside
ones). In that case, parallel closedness of all inside critical pairs implies conditions
(ii) and (iii) of PCPC, according to CPC
HT
(ii). This is obvious for PCPC(ii), and
PCPC(iii) only has to hold for (ordinary) inside critical peaks which is guaranteed
again by CPC
HT
(ii).
Finally, let us briey discuss related work and possible extensions of our approach. First
of all, it seems rather straightforward to generalize our approach to a `commutation
setting' analogous to the one of Toyama ([Toy88]) mentioned above for Theorem 3.7.
Furthermore, we would like to mention one possible source of renements for Theorem
4.11 (and related critical pair based conuence criteria) which is based on making use
of the ambiguity of rewriting. More precisely, it may be the case that a parallel critical
peak t
1 >
 k   s !

t
2
as in PCPC(iii) is not joinable from left to right as required.
However, it might e.g. be (an instance of) another outside critical peak t
0
1

 s
0
!

t
0
2
which satises PCPC(i), i.e., t

and t
0
1
!

t
4
 k   t
0
2
for some t

3
, t

4
. In this
case the reasoning in the proof of Theorem 4.11 still applies. The following simple
example ilustrates this kind of renement.
Example 5.5 (rening PCPC)
The TRS
R =
8
>
<
>
:
f(a)! f(f(a))
a! b
f(x)! f(b)
does not satisfy PCPC(iii) since for the inside critical peak f(b)
>
 f(a) !

f(f(a))
we do not have f(b) !

f(f(a)). However, we also have the outside critical peak
f(b)

 f(a) !

f(f(a)), which is strongly joinable in the sense of PCPC(i), due to
f(f(a))! f(b). Hence, parallel reduction in R is strongly conuent.
Similar renements are also possible for Theorem 3.7.
Another direction of extending our approach is to combine it with the recent results of
van Oostrom ([Oos94b]) who showed that the approach of Huet/Toyama can be gen-
eralized by replacing parallel reduction steps by the more general so-called (complete)
18
developments, using essentially the same proof structure as in Theorem 3.7.
10
The
basic idea of developments roughly is that a set of rewrite steps is considered to be
parallel if a `parallel extraction' of all the steps in the set is possible ([Oos94b]). This
implies for instance, that in a (left-linear) TRS a derivation s = l!
p

0
l!
;
0
;l!r

0
r
(with p  q for some q 2 VPos(l)) can be viewed as a single parallel step. It seems that
our approach via parallel critical pairs developed in this paper and the approach of van
Oostrom generalizing the notion of being `parallel' are `orthogonal' to each other, hence
it should be possible to combine both as well as the corresponding proof structures.
Similarly, it is conceivable that our approach can also be combined with (proof tech-
niques for) conuence results for the higher-order rewrite systems of [MN94].
Last but not least we think that the notion of parallel critical pairs that we have
explicitly introduced here might turn out to be fruitful for other purposes, too. But
this remains to be seen.

Final Note: It should be mentioned that Yoshihito Toyama, after having read (a
longer version of) this paper, informed the author ([Toy95]) about the existence of
another very early paper, namely \Y. Toyama: On the Church-Rosser property of term
rewriting systems, NTT ECL Technical Report 17672 (Dec. 23, 1981), in Japanese",
containing very similar ideas and results. The relationships between the latter paper
and ours as well as possible extensions and renements will be investigated in joint
future research.
