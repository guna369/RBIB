Finding the Shortest Move-Sequence in the Graph-Generalized 15-Puzzle is NP-Hard
Oded Goldreich
Abstract. Following Wilson (J. Comb. Th. (B), 1975), Johnson (J. of Alg., 1983), and Kornhauser, Miller and Spirakis (25th FOCS, 1984), we consider a game that consists of moving distinct pebbles along the edges of an undirected graph. At most one pebble may reside in each vertex at any time, and it is only allowed to move one pebble at a time (which means that the pebble must be moved to a previously empty vertex). We show that the problem of ﬁnding the shortest sequence of moves between two given “pebble conﬁguations” is NP-Hard.

1 Problem’s Deﬁnition
The following generalization of the “15-Puzzle” appeared in [4, 2, 3]:
Board: The game is played on a ﬁnite, undirected, simple graph. The graph will be denoted by G(V, E).
Legal Board Conﬁguration: Every vertex contains at most one pebble, and one vertex is empty. That is, BC : V → {0, 1, 2, . . . , |V | − 1} is a legal board conﬁguration if it is one-to-one and onto. The board conﬁguration is interpreted as follows: if BC(v) = 0, then vertex v contains pebble BC(v), and if BC(v) = 0, then vertex v is empty.
Legal Moves: A legal move consists of moving a single pebble, along one of the edges of the graph to an empty vertex. A legal move is a transformation on the set of legal conﬁgurations. Let BC(·) be a legal conﬁguration and BC′(·) be the conﬁguration that results from BC(·) after a legal move. Then, there exist two adjacent vertices, u, v ∈ V (i.e., (u, v) ∈ E), such that BC′(u) = BC(v), BC′(v) = BC(u) = 0, and BC′(w) = BC(w) for all w ∈ V \ {u, v}. In this move the pebble BC(v) is moved from vertex v to vertex u.

2
A sequence of moves: A sequence of t moves is a sequence of legal board conﬁgurations, denoted BC0(·), BC1(·), BC2(·), . . . , BCt(·), such that for i = 1, . . . , t it holds that BCi(·) is the result of applying a legal move to BCi−1(·). The conﬁguration BC0(·) is called the beginning conﬁguration of the above sequence, and the conﬁguration BCt(·) is called the ﬁnishing conﬁguration of the above sequence.
Solutions: A pair of legal board conﬁgurations is said to have a solution if there exists a sequence of moves beginning at the ﬁrst and ﬁnishing at the second.
2 Prior Work
Kornhauser, Miller and Spirakis [3] showed that, for any nonseparable graph G(V, E), if a pair of legal board conﬁgurations has a solution, then it has a solution by O(|V |3) moves. Furthermore, they showed that such a solution (by O(|V |3) moves) can be found in O(|V |3) time. A natural algorithmic question arises:
Given a pair of legal board conﬁgurations that does have a solution, Is it feasible to ﬁnd the shortest solution?
We answer this question negatively, proving that ﬁnding such a solution is NPHard.
3 The NP-Completeness Result
In order to discuss the problem of ﬁnding the shortest solution to a solvable pair of legal board conﬁgurations, we introduce the following decision problem, herafter referred to as the Shortest Move Sequence (SMS) Problem:
Input: A nonseparable, simple, undirected graph G(V, E); a pair, B(·) and F (·), of legal board conﬁguration; and an integer K.
Question: Is there a sequence of K (or less) legal moves beginning at B(·) and ﬁnishing at F (·)?
We prove the following result.
Theorem: The Shortest Move Sequence (SMS) problem is NP-Complete.
Proof: First note that SMS is in NP (since, w.l.o.g., K = O(|V |3)). We prove that SMS is complete by reducing 3-Exact-Cover (3XC) to it. Recall that the 3XC is deﬁned as follows: Input: A set U = {ei}3i=n1 and a collection S = {sj}mj=1 of 3-element subsets
(3-subsets) of U . Question: Is there a subcollection, S′ ⊆ S, such that every element in U occurs
in exactly one member of S′? If existing, such a collection, S′, is called an exact cover. (Also, |S| = n.)

Recall that Karp has proved that 3XC is NP-complete (see [1]). Now, given an instance of 3XC, denoted (U = {ei}3i=n1 , S = {sj}mj=1), we construct the following SMS instance:

– Let V = U 0 ∪ U 1 ∪ S ∪ {t}, where U σ = {eσ : e ∈ U } for σ ∈ {0, 1}. The vertices e0 and e1 will be associated with the element e ∈ U . The vertices
in S will be associated with the corresponding 3-subsets. The vertex t will
be called the temporary vertex. – Let E = E3XC ∪ {(t, s) : s ∈ S} ∪ {(e0, e1) : e ∈ U }, where

E3XC = {(eσ, s) : σ ∈ {0, 1} ∧ e ∈ U ∧ e ∈ s}.

The edges in E3XC encode the description of the 3XC instance. Note that (eσ, s) ∈ E3XC iﬀ the element e ∈ U appears in the 3-subset s ∈ S. – Let B(eσi ) = 2i − 1 + σ, for 1 ≤ i ≤ 3n and σ ∈ {0, 1}, and B(sj) = 6n + j, for 1 ≤ j ≤ m. Let B(t) = 0.
In the begin conﬁgurations t is empty while the pebbles are placed in a
“canonical” order. In particular, the pebbles 2i − 1 and 2i, which are associated with the element ei (for 1 ≤ i ≤ 3n), are placed in vertices e0i and e1i , respectively. The pebble 6n + j, which is associated with the 3-subset sj (for
1 ≤ j ≤ m), is placed in vertex sj. – Let F (eσi ) = 2i − σ, for 1 ≤ i ≤ 3n and σ ∈ {0, 1}, and F (sj) = 6n + j, for
1 ≤ j ≤ m. Let F (t) = 0.
In the ﬁnish conﬁgurations t is still empty and the pebbles in the vertices
that are associated with the 3-subsets remain invariant w.r.t the begin con-
ﬁguration. The pebbles associated with each element of U are switched w.r.t
the begin conﬁguration.
– Finally, let K = 11n.

Having presented our reduction it remains to show that it is indeed valid.

Assume that the 3XC instance has an exact cover, denoted S′ =

sij

n j=1

.

Let f : {1, 2, . . . , n} × {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, . . . , 3n} such that ef(j,k) is the k-th

element in the 3-subset sij (where the order on the elements in each 3-subset

is induced by an ordering of U ). Note that sij = {ef(j,1), ef(j,2), ef(j,3)} and

U = {ef(j,k) : 1 ≤ j ≤ n ∧ 1 ≤ k ≤ 3}. Then, following is a solution to the

corresponding SMS instance:

for j = 1 to n do begin
move pebble 6n + ij from sij to t; for k = 1 to 3 do begin
move pebble 2f (j, k) − 1 from e0f(j,k) to sij ; move pebble 2f (j, k) from e1f(j,k) to e0f(j,k); move pebble 2f (j, k) − 1 from sij to e1f(j,k); [Comment: At this stage, for every k ∈ {1, 2, 3},
the pebbles 2f (j, k) − 1 and 2f (j, k) are switched.]
end
move pebble 6n + ij from t to sij ;

4
[Comment: At this stage all pebbles associated to elements in sij are switched and all the pebbles associated with 3-subsets are back in place.] end
One can easily verify that the foregoing procedure transforms the begin conﬁguration into the ﬁnish conﬁguration in (1 + 3 · 3 + 1) · n = K moves
Assume, on the other hand, that the SMS instance has a solution in no more than K = 11n moves. Let us denote this solution (i.e., sequence of moves) by Q. Recall that in each move a single pebble is moved (to an empty vertex). The following facts concerning Q can be easily veriﬁed:
Fact 1 : Switching pebble 2i − 1 with pebble 2i (1 ≤ i ≤ 3n) requires at least two moves of one of these pebbles and at least one move of the other pebble. Furthermore, this switching requires that at least one of these pebbles passes through a vertex associated with a 3-subset that contains the element ei. The main part follows from the fact that each move must be to a previously empty vertex, and the furthermore part follows by the graph’s structure.
Fact 2: If some pebble passes through a 3-subset vertex sj (1 ≤ j ≤ m) during Q, then the pebble 6n + j must have been moved during Q.
Let M denote the set of pebbles that are associated with 3-subsets that moved during Q. Using Facts 1 and 2, we get.
Fact 3: The number of moves in Q is at least 3 · 3n + 2 · |M |.
Recall the number of moves (in Q) is at most K = 11n. Thus:
Fact 4: |M | ≤ n.
Fact 5: The collection C = {sj : 6n + j ∈ M } constitutes a cover of the set U . That is, for every element e ∈ U , there exists a 3-subset s ∈ C such that e ∈ s. Note that 2i − 1 has been switched with 2i, for each 1 ≤ i ≤ 3n, and by Facts 1 and 2 this implies that for some j such that ei ∈ sj it holds that 6n + j ∈ M .
Combining Facts 4 and 5, we conclude that C is an exact cover of the 3XC instance. This completes the proof of the theorem.
