Abstract. We extend the notion of Heyting algebra to a notion of truth
values algebra and prove that a theory is consistent if and only if it has
a B-valued model for some non trivial truth values algebra B. A theory
that has a B-valued model for all truth values algebras B is said to be
super-consistent. We prove that super-consistency is a model-theoretic
sufficient condition for strong normalization.
1 Introduction
Proving that a theory has the cut elimination property has some similarities
with proving that it has a model. These similarities appear, for instance, in the
model theoretic proofs of cut elimination, where cut elimination is obtained as
a corollary of a strengthening of the completeness theorem, expressing that if a
formula is valid in all models of a theory, then it has a cut free proof in this theory.
Such a method has been used, for instance, by Schu¨tte, Kanger, Beth, Hintikka
and Smullyan. It has then been used by Tait [15], Prawitz [13], Takahashi [17]
and Andrews [1] to prove cut elimination for simple type theory. It has been
generalized, more recently, by De Marco and Lipton [2] to prove cut elimination
for an intuitionistic variant of simple type theory, by Hermant [8, 10] to prove
cut elimination for classical and intuitionistic theories in deduction modulo and
by Okada [11] to prove cut elimination for intuitionistic linear logic.
An alternative method to prove cut elimination is to prove that all proofs
strongly normalize. Following Tait [16] and Girard [7], this is proved by assigning
a set of proofs, called a reducibility candidate, to each formula. Here also, the
proofs have some similarities with the construction of models, except that, in
these models, the truth values 0 and 1 are replaced by reducibility candidates.
This analogy has been exploited in a joint work with Werner [5], where we have
defined a notion of reducibility candidate valued models, called pre-models, and
proved that if a theory in deduction modulo has such a model, then it has the
strong normalization property.
The fact that both cut elimination proofs and strong normalization proofs
proceed by building models raises the problem of the difference between cut
elimination and strong normalization. It is well-known that strong normalization
implies cut elimination, but what about the converse ? This problem can be
precisely stated in deduction modulo, where instead of using an ad hoc notion
of cut for each theory of interest, we can formulate a general notion of cut for a
large class of theories, that subsumes the usual ad hoc notions. This problem has
been solved by Hermant [9] and surprisingly the answer is negative: there are
theories that have the cut elimination property, but not the strong normalization
property and even not the weak normalization property. Thus, although the
model theoretic cut elimination proofs and the strong normalization proofs both
proceed by building models, these methods apply to different theories.
In this paper, we focus on the model theoretic characterization of theories
in deduction modulo that have the strong normalization property. It has been
proved in [5] that a theory has the strong normalization property if it has a
reducibility candidate valued model. However, the usual model constructions
use very little of the properties of reducibility candidates. In particular, these
constructions seem to work independently of the chosen variant of the closure
conditions defining reducibility candidates. This suggests that this notion of
reducibility candidate valued model can be further generalized, by considering
an abstract notion of reducibility candidate.
Abstracting this way on the notion of reducibility candidate leads to intro-
duce a class of algebras, called truth values algebras, that also generalize Heyting
algebras. However there is an important difference between truth values algebras
and Heyting algebras: in a Heyting algebra valued model the formula P ⇔ Q is
valid if and only if the formulae P and Q have the same denotation. In particular,
all theorems have the same denotation. This is not necessarily the case in truth
values algebra valued models where two theorems may have different denotation.
Thus, truth values algebra valued models are more “intentional” than Heyting
algebra valued models. In particular, it is possible to distinguish in the model
between the computational equivalence of formulae (the congruence of deduction
modulo, or the definitional equality of Martin-Lo¨f’s type theory) and the prov-
able equivalence: the denotations of two computationally equivalent formulae are
the same, but not necessarily those of two logically equivalent formulae. Thus,
independently of normalization, this generalization of Heyting algebras seems to
be of interest for the model theory of deduction modulo and type theory.
We shall first introduce the notion of truth values algebra and compare it
with the notion of Heyting algebra. Then, we shall consider plain predicate
logic, define a notion of model based on these truth values algebras and prove
a soundness and a completeness theorem for this notion of model. We shall
then show that this notion of model extends to deduction modulo. Finally, we
shall strengthen the notion of consistency into a notion of super-consistency and
prove that all super-consistent theories have the strong normalization property.
We refer to the long version of the paper for the proofs omitted in this abstract.
2 Truth values algebras
2.1 Definition
Definition 1 (Truth values algebra). Let B be a set, whose elements are
called truth values, B+ be a subset of B, whose elements are called positive truth
values, A and E be subsets of ℘(B), ⊤˜ and ⊥˜ be elements of B, ⇒˜, ∧˜, and ∨˜
be functions from B × B to B, ∀˜ be a function from A to B and ∃˜ be a function
from E to B. The structure B = 〈B,B+,A, E , ⊤˜, ⊥˜, ⇒˜, ∧˜, ∨˜, ∀˜, ∃˜〉 is said to be a
truth value algebra if the set B+ is closed by the intuitionistic deduction rules
i.e. if for all a, b, c in B, A in A and E in E,
1. if a ⇒˜ b ∈ B+ and a ∈ B+ then b ∈ B+,
2. a ⇒˜ b ⇒˜ a ∈ B+,
3. (a ⇒˜ b ⇒˜ c) ⇒˜ (a ⇒˜ b) ⇒˜ a ⇒˜ c ∈ B+,
4. ⊤˜ ∈ B+,
5. ⊥˜ ⇒˜ a ∈ B+,
6. a ⇒˜ b ⇒˜ (a ∧˜ b) ∈ B+,
7. (a ∧˜ b) ⇒˜ a ∈ B+,
8. (a ∧˜ b) ⇒˜ b ∈ B+,
9. a ⇒˜ (a ∨˜ b) ∈ B+,
10. b ⇒˜ (a ∨˜ b) ∈ B+,
11. (a ∨˜ b) ⇒˜ (a ⇒˜ c) ⇒˜ (b ⇒˜ c) ⇒˜ c ∈ B+,
12. the set a ⇒˜ A = {a ⇒˜ e | e ∈ A} is in A and the set E ⇒˜ a = {e ⇒˜ a | e ∈
E} is in A,
13. if all elements of A are in B+ then ∀˜ A ∈ B+,
14. ∀˜ (a ⇒˜ A) ⇒˜ a ⇒˜ (∀˜ A) ∈ B+,
15. if a ∈ A, then (∀˜ A) ⇒˜ a ∈ B+,
16. if a ∈ E, then a ⇒˜ (∃˜ E) ∈ B+,
17. (∃˜ E) ⇒˜ ∀˜ (E ⇒˜ a) ⇒˜ a ∈ B+.
Definition 2 (Full). A truth values algebra is said to be full if A = E = ℘(B),
i.e. if ∀˜ A and ∃˜ A exist for all subsets A of B.
Definition 3 (Trivial). A truth values algebra is said to be trivial if B+ = B.
Example 1. Let B = {0, 1}. Let B+ = {1}, A = E = ℘(B), ⊤˜ = 1, ⊥˜ = 0, ⇒˜,
∧˜, ∨˜ be the usual boolean operations, ∀˜ be the function mapping the sets {0}
and {0, 1} to 0 and ∅ and {1} to 1 and ∃˜ be the function mapping the sets ∅
and {0} to 0 and {1} and {0, 1} to 1. Then 〈B,B+,A, E , ⊤˜, ⊥˜, ⇒˜, ∧˜, ∨˜, ∀˜, ∃˜〉 is a
truth value algebra.
Example 2. Let B be an arbitrary set, B+ = B, A = E = ℘(B) and ⊤˜, ⊥˜, ⇒˜,
∧˜, ∨˜, ∀˜ and ∃˜ be arbitrary operations. Then 〈B,B+,A, E , ⊤˜, ⊥˜, ⇒˜, ∧˜, ∨˜, ∀˜, ∃˜〉 is
a trivial truth value algebra.
2.2 Pseudo-Heyting algebras
In this section, we show that truth values algebras can alternatively be charac-
terized as pseudo-Heyting algebras.
Definition 4 (Pseudo-Heyting algebra).
Let B be a set, ≤ be a relation on B, A and E be subsets of ℘(B), ⊤˜
and ⊥˜ be elements of B, ⇒˜, ∧˜, and ∨˜ be functions from B × B to B, ∀˜ be
a function from A to B and ∃˜ be a function from E to B, the structure B =
〈B,≤,A, E , ⊤˜, ⊥˜, ⇒˜, ∧˜, ∨˜, ∀˜, ∃˜〉 is said to be a pseudo-Heyting algebra if for all
a, b, c in B, A in A and E in E, (the relation ≤ is a pre-order)
– a ≤ a,
– if a ≤ b and b ≤ c then a ≤ c,
(⊤˜ and ⊥˜ are maximum and minimum elements (notice that these need not be
unique))
– a ≤ ⊤˜,
– ⊥˜ ≤ a,
(a ∧˜ b is a greatest lower bound of a and b and and a ∨˜ b is a least upper bound
of a and b (again, these need not be unique))
– a ∧˜ b ≤ a,
– a ∧˜ b ≤ b,
– if c ≤ a and c ≤ b then c ≤ a ∧˜ b,
– a ≤ a ∨˜ b,
– b ≤ a ∨˜ b,
– if a ≤ c and b ≤ c then a ∨˜ b ≤ c,
(the set A and E have closure conditions)
– a ⇒˜ A and E ⇒˜ a are in A,
(∀˜ and ∃˜ are infinite greatest lower bound and least upper bound)
– if a ∈ A then ∀˜ A ≤ a,
– if for all a in A, b ≤ a then b ≤ ∀˜ A,
– if a ∈ E then a ≤ ∃˜ E,
– if for all a in E, a ≤ b then ∃˜ E ≤ b,
and
– a ≤ b ⇒˜ c if and only if a ∧˜ b ≤ c.
Proposition 1. Consider a truth values algebra 〈B,B+,A, E , ⊤˜, ⊥˜, ⇒˜, ∧˜, ∨˜, ∀˜, ∃˜〉
then the algebra 〈B,≤,A, E , ⊤˜, ⊥˜, ⇒˜, ∧˜, ∨˜, ∀˜, ∃˜〉 where the relation ≤ is defined
by a ≤ b if and only if a ⇒˜ b ∈ B+ is a pseudo-Heyting algebra.
Conversely, consider a pseudo-Heyting algebra 〈B,≤,A, E , ⊤˜, ⊥˜, ⇒˜, ∧˜, ∨˜, ∀˜, ∃˜〉,
then the algebra 〈B,B+,A, E , ⊤˜, ⊥˜, ⇒˜, ∧˜, ∨˜, ∀˜, ∃˜〉, where B+ = {x | ⊤˜ ≤ x} is a
truth values algebra.
Definition 5 (Heyting algebra). A pseudo-Heyting algebra is said to be a
Heyting algebra if the relation ≤ is antisymmetric
– x ≤ y ⇒ y ≤ x⇒ x = y.
Remark. If the pseudo-Heyting algebra 〈B,≤,A, E , ⊤˜, ⊥˜, ⇒˜, ∧˜, ∨˜, ∀˜, ∃˜〉 is a Heyt-
ing algebra, then the set B+ = {x | ⊤˜ ≤ x} is the singleton {⊤˜}. Indeed, if
a ∈ B+ then ⊤˜ ≤ a and a ≤ ⊤˜. Hence a = ⊤˜.
Definition 6. A function F from a truth value algebra B1 to a truth value
algebra B2 is said to be a morphism of truth values algebras if
– x ∈ B+
1
if and only if F (x) ∈ B+
2
,
– if A ∈ A1 then F (A) ∈ A2, if E ∈ E1 then F (E) ∈ E2,
– F (⊤˜1) = ⊤˜2, F (⊥˜1) = ⊥˜2, F (a ⇒˜1 b) = F (a) ⇒˜2 F (b), F (a ∧˜1 b) =
F (a) ∧˜2 F (b), F (a ∨˜1 b) = F (a) ∨˜2 F (b), F (∀˜1 A) = ∀˜2 F (A), F (∃˜1 E) =
∃˜2 F (E).
Morphisms of pseudo-Heyting algebras are defined in a similar way except that
the first condition is replaced by
– x ≤1 y if and only if F (x) ≤2 F (y).
Proposition 2. Let B be a pseudo-Heyting algebra, then there exists a pseudo-
Heyting algebra B/B+ that is a Heyting algebra and a morphism of pseudo-
Heyting algebras Φ from B to B/B+.
Remark.We have proved that, in the definition of Heyting algebras, the antisym-
metry is useless and can be dropped. The equivalence of truth values algebras
and pseudo-Heyting algebras shows that antisymmetry is the only property that
can be dropped and that truth values algebras are, in some sense, the best pos-
sible generalization of Heyting algebras, as we cannot require less than closure
by intuitionistic deduction rules.
2.3 Examples of truth values algebras
We have seen that the algebra {0, 1} is a truth value algebra and more generally
that all Heyting algebras are truth values algebras. We give in this section two
examples of truth values algebras that are not Heyting algebras.
Example 3. The truth value algebra T1 is defined as follows. The set T1 is {0, I, 1}
and the set T +1 is {I, 1}. The sets A and E are ℘(T1). The functions ⊤˜, ⊥˜, ∧˜, ∨˜,
∀˜ and ∃˜ are the same as in the algebra {0, 1}, except that their value on I is the
same as their value on 1. For instance the table of the operation ∨˜ is
0 I 1
0 0 1 1
I 1 1 1
1 1 1 1
The function ⇒˜ is defined by the table
0 I 1
0 1 1 1
I 0 1 1
1 0 I I
Notice that as I ⇒˜ 1 and 1 ⇒˜ I are both in T +1 we have I ≤ 1 and 1 ≤ I.
Hence the relation ≤ is not antisymmetric and the truth value algebra T1 is not
a Heyting algebra.
Example 4. The truth value algebra T2 is similar to T1, except that the function
⇒˜ is defined by the table
0 I 1
0 1 1 I
I 0 1 I
1 0 1 I
2.4 Ordered truth values algebras
We consider truth values algebras extended with an order relation ⊑ on B. This
order relation extends to sets of truth values in a trivial way: A ⊑ B if for all x
in A there exists a y in B such that x ⊑ y.
Definition 7 (Ordered truth values algebra). An ordered truth values al-
gebra is a truth values algebra together with a relation ⊑ on B such that
– ⊑ is an order relation,
– B+ is upward closed,
– ⊤˜ is a maximal element, ⊥˜ a minimal element,
– ∧˜, ∨˜, ∀˜ and ∃˜ are monotonous, ⇒˜ is left anti-monotonous and right monotonous.
Definition 8 (Complete ordered truth values algebra). A ordered truth
values algebra is said to be complete if every subset of B has a greatest lower
bound for ⊑. Notice that this implies that every subset also has a least upper
bound. We write glb(a, b) and lub(a, b) the greatest lower bound and the least
upper bound of a and b for the order ⊑.
Example 5. The algebra T1 ordered by 0 ⊑ I ⊑ 1 is complete.
Example 6. The algebra T2 cannot be extended to a complete ordered algebra.
Indeed the set {I, 1} would need to have a least upper bound. This least upper
bound cannot be 0 because T +2 would then not be upward closed. If it were 1
then we would have I ⊑ 1 and thus 1 ⇒˜ I ⊑ 1 ⇒˜ 1, i.e. 1 ⊑ I. Thus the relation
⊑ would not be antisymmetric. If it were I then we would have 1 ⊑ I and thus
1 ⇒˜ 1 ⊑ 1 ⇒˜ I, i.e. I ⊑ 1. Thus the relation ⊑ would not be antisymmetric.
Proposition 3. In a Heyting algebra, ≤ and ⊑ are extensionally equal, i.e.
a ⊑ b if and only if a ≤ b.
2.5 Completion
We now want to prove that for any truth value algebra B, there is another truth
value algebra BC that is full, ordered and complete and a morphism Φ from B
to BC . Notice that we do not require the morphism Φ to be injective.
There are two ways to prove this, the first is to use Proposition 2 in a first step
to build a truth value algebra B/B+ that is a Heyting algebra and a morphism for
B to B/B+ and then apply in a second step MacNeille completion to the algebra
B/B+ to embed it into a full Heyting algebra. Together with its natural order,
this algebra is a full, ordered and complete truth value algebra. The second is
to apply MacNeille completion directly to B noticing that antisymmetry is not
used in MacNeille completion, except to prove the injectivity of the morphism.
The proof is detailed in the long version of the paper.
Example 7. The algebra T2 cannot be extended to a complete ordered algebra,
but it can be embedded with a non injective morphism in the full ordered and
complete algebra {0, 1}.
3 Predicate Logic
3.1 Models
Definition 9 (B-valued structure). Let L = 〈fi, Pj〉 be a language in predi-
cate logic and B be a truth values algebra, a B-valued structure for the language
L, M = 〈M,B, fˆi, Pˆj〉 is a structure such that fˆi is a function from M
n to M
where n is the arity of the symbol fi and Pˆj is a function from M
n to B where
n is the arity of the symbol Pi.
This definition extends trivially to many-sorted languages.
Definition 10 (Denotation). Let B be a truth values algebra,M be a B-valued
structure and φ be an assignment. The denotation JAKφ of a formula A in M is
defined as follows
– JxKφ = φ(x),
– Jf(t1, ..., tn)Kφ = fˆ(Jt1Kφ, ..., JtnKφ),
– JP (t1, ..., tn)Kφ = Pˆ (Jt1Kφ, ..., JtnKφ),
– J⊤Kφ = ⊤˜,
– J⊥Kφ = ⊥˜,
– JA⇒ BKφ = JAKφ ⇒˜ JBKφ,
– JA ∧BKφ = JAKφ ∧˜ JBKφ,
– JA ∨BKφ = JAKφ ∨˜ JBKφ,
– J∀x AKφ = ∀˜ {JAKφ+〈x,e〉 | e ∈M},
– J∃x AKφ = ∃˜ {JAKφ+〈x,e〉 | e ∈M}.
Notice that the denotation of a formula containing quantifiers may be undefined,
but it is always defined if the truth value algebra is full.
Definition 11 (Model). A formula A is said to be valid in a B-valued structure
M, and the B-valued structure M is said to be a model of A, M |= A, if for all
assignments φ, JAKφ is defined and is a positive truth value.
The B-valued structureM is said to be a model of a theory T if it is a model
of all the axioms of T .
3.2 Soundness and completeness
As the notion of truth values algebra extends that of Heyting algebra, the com-
pleteness theorem for the notion of model introduced above is a simple corollary
of the completeness theorem for the notion of model based on Heyting algebras.
But, it has a simpler direct proof. It is well-known that completeness proofs for
boolean algebra valued models and Heyting algebra valued models are simpler
than for {0, 1}-valued models. For truth values algebra valued models, it is even
simpler. We want to prove that if A is valid in all models of T where it has
a denotation then T ⊢ A. To do so, we consider a theory T and we construct
a model of T such that the formulae valid in this model are the intuitionistic
theorems of T .
Definition 12 (Lindenbaum model). Let T be a theory in a language L. Let
S be an infinite set of constants and L′ = L∪S. Let M be the set of closed terms
of L′ and BT be the set of closed formulae of L
′. Let B+T be the set of elements A
of BT , such that the sequent T ⊢ A is provable. Let A = E be the set of subsets
of BT of the form {(t/x)A | t ∈ M} for some A. Notice that, in this case, the
formula A is unique.
The operations ⊤˜, ⊥˜, ⇒˜, ∧˜ and ∨˜ are ⊤, ⊥, ⇒, ∧ and ∨. The operations ∀˜
and ∃˜ are defined as follows
– ∀˜ {(t/x)A | t ∈M} = (∀x A),
– ∃˜ {(t/x)A | t ∈M} = (∃x A).
If f is a function symbol, we let fˆ be the function mapping t1, ..., tn to f(t1, ..., tn).
If P is a predicate symbol, we let Pˆ be the function mapping t1, ..., tn to P (t1, ..., tn).
Proposition 4. The algebra BT is a truth values algebra.
Proposition 5 (Completeness). If A is valid in all the models of T where it
is defined, then T ⊢ A.
Using completion, we can strengthen this completeness theorem.
Proposition 6. If A is valid in all the models of T where the truth values
algebra is full, ordered and complete then T ⊢ A.
The converse is a simple induction over proof structure.
Proposition 7 (Soundness). If T ⊢ A then A is valid in all the models of T
where the truth value algebra is full, ordered and complete.
We finally get the following theorem.
Theorem 1. T ⊢ A if and only if A is valid in all the models of T where the
truth values algebra is full, ordered and complete.
3.3 Consistency
Definition 13. A theory is said to be consistent if there exists a non provable
formula in this theory.
In the completeness theorem above, we did not assume the theory T to be
consistent. If it is not, then the algebra of the Lindenbaum model is trivial, i.e.
all truth values are positive and every formula is valid. But we have the following
theorem.
Proposition 8. The theory T is consistent if and only if it has a B-valued
model, for some non trivial full, ordered and complete truth values algebra B.
4 Deduction modulo
4.1 Deduction modulo
In Deduction modulo [3, 5], a theory is defined by a set of axioms T and a
congruence ≡ defined by a confluent rewrite system rewriting terms to terms
and atomic formulae to formulae. The deduction rules are modified to take the
congruence ≡ into account. For instance, the modus ponens rule is not stated as
usual
Γ ⊢≡ A⇒ B Γ ⊢≡ A
Γ ⊢≡ B
but
Γ ⊢≡ C Γ ⊢≡ A
C ≡ A⇒ B
Γ ⊢≡ B
In deduction modulo, some proofs, in some theories, do not normalize. For
instance, in the theory formed with the rewrite rule P −→ (P ⇒ Q), the proof
axiom
P ⊢≡ P ⇒ Q
axiom
P ⊢≡ P
⇒-elim
P ⊢≡ Q
⇒-intro
⊢≡ P ⇒ Q
axiom
P ⊢≡ P ⇒ Q
axiom
P ⊢≡ P
⇒-elim
P ⊢≡ Q
⇒-intro
⊢≡ P
⇒-elim
⊢≡ Q
does not normalize and, moreover, the formula Q has no normal proof.
But, as we shall see, in some other theories, such as the theory formed with
the rewrite rule P −→ (Q⇒ P ), all proofs strongly normalize.
In deduction modulo, like in predicate logic, normal proofs of a sequent of
the form ⊢≡ A always end with an introduction rule. Thus, when a theory can
be expressed in deduction modulo with rewrite rules only, i.e. with no axioms, in
such a way that proofs modulo these rewrite rules strongly normalize, then the
theory is consistent, it has the disjunction property and the witness property,
various proof search methods for this theory are complete, ...
Many theories can be expressed this way in deduction modulo, in particular
arithmetic [6] and simple type theory [4] and the notion of cut of deduction
modulo subsumes the ad hoc notions of cut defined for these theories.
4.2 Models
Definition 14 (Model). Let T ,≡ be a theory in deduction modulo. The B-
valued structure M is said to be a model of the theory T ,≡ if all axioms of T
are valid in M and for all terms or formulae A and B such that A ≡ B and
assignment φ, JAKφ and JBKφ are defined and JAKφ = JBKφ.
Example 8. Let B be an arbitrary truth value algebra, then the theory P −→
(Q⇒ R) has a B-valued model. We take Pˆ = (⊤˜ ⇒˜ ⊤˜) and Qˆ = Rˆ = ⊤˜.
Example 9. Let B be an arbitrary full, ordered and complete truth value algebra,
then the theory P −→ (Q ⇒ P ) has a B-valued model. The function a 7→
(⊥˜ ⇒˜ a) is monotonous for the order ⊑ and this order is complete. Hence, it has
a fixed point b. We define a B-valued model of this theory by Pˆ = b and Qˆ = ⊥˜.
In the same way, if B be an arbitrary full, ordered and complete truth value
algebra, then the theory P −→ (⊥ ⇒ P ) has a B-valued model.
Example 10. The theory P −→ (P ⇒ Q) has a {0, 1}-valued model (Pˆ = Qˆ =
1), but no T1-valued model. Indeed there is no 0 in the line 0 of the table of the
function ⇒˜ of T1, no I in the line I and no 1 in the line 1.
4.3 Soundness and completeness
To extend the completeness and the soundness theorem to deduction modulo, we
replace terms by classes of congruent terms and formulae by classes of congruent
formulae.
Definition 15 (Lindenbaum model). Let T ,≡ be a theory in a language L.
Let S be an infinite set of constants and L′ = L ∪ S. Let M be the set of ≡-
classes of closed terms of L′ and B be the set of ≡-classes of closed formulae
of L′. Let B+ be the set of elements of B containing a formula A such that the
sequent T ⊢≡ A is provable. Let A = E be the set of subsets of B of the form
{(t/x)A/ ≡ | t ∈M} for some A.
The operations ⊤˜, ⊥˜, ⇒˜, ∧˜ and ∨˜ are ⊤, ⊥, ⇒, ∧ and ∨ extended to ≡-
classes. To define the operations ∀˜ and ∃˜, we choose for each element a of A
and E a formula A such that a = {(t/x)A/ ≡ | t ∈ M} and we let
– ∀˜ a = (∀x A),
– ∃˜ a = (∃x A).
If f is a function symbol, we let fˆ be the function mapping the classes of t1, ..., tn
to that of f(t1, ..., tn). If P is a predicate symbol, we let Pˆ be the function mapping
the classes of t1, ..., tn to that of P (t1, ..., tn).
However, this introduces some additional complexity as we lose the property
that the class of formulae A is uniquely determined by the set of classes of formu-
lae {(t/x)A | t ∈ M}. Indeed, consider, for instance, the congruence generated
by the rewrite rule f(f(x)) −→ x. Then the formulae P (x) and P (f(x)) have the
same set of instances (the instance t in one formula corresponds to the instance
f(t) in the other). Thus, we need first the following definition and proposition.
Definition 16. Two sets A and B of (classes of) formulae are said to be equiv-
alent modulo ≡ if for each formula P in A there exists a formula Q in B such
that P ⇔ Q is provable in deduction modulo ≡ and vice versa.
Proposition 9. Let ≡ be a congruence defined by a confluent rewrite system
rewriting terms to terms and atomic formulae to formulae. Let P and Q be two
formulae such that the sets {(t/x)P/ ≡ | t ∈ M} and {(t/x)Q/ ≡ | t ∈ M}
are equivalent modulo ≡, then (∀x P )⇒ (∀x Q) is provable in deduction modulo
the congruence ≡.
Proposition 10. The algebra B is a truth values algebra.
Proposition 11 (Completeness). If A is valid in all the models of T ,≡ where
it is defined, then T ⊢≡ A.
Using completion, we can strengthen this completeness theorem.
Proposition 12. If A is valid in all the models of T ,≡ where the truth values
algebra is full, ordered and complete then T ⊢≡ A.
The converse is a simple induction over proof structure.
Proposition 13 (Soundness). If T ⊢≡ A then A is valid in all the models of
T ,≡ where the truth value algebra is full, ordered and complete.
We finally get the following theorem.
Theorem 2. T ⊢≡ A if and only if A is valid in all the models of T ,≡ where
the truth values algebra is full, ordered and complete.
4.4 Consistency
Proposition 14. The theory T ,≡ is consistent if and only if it has a B-valued
model, for some non trivial full, ordered and complete truth values algebra B.
5 Super-consistency
5.1 Definition
By Proposition 14, a theory is consistent if it has a B-valued model for some non
trivial full, ordered and complete truth values algebra. We now strengthen this
condition and require that the theory has a B-valued model for all full, ordered
and complete truth values algebras B.
Definition 17 (Super-consistent). A theory T ,≡ in deduction modulo is
super-consistent if it has a B-valued model for all full, ordered and complete
truth values algebras B.
Notice that, as there exists non trivial full, ordered and complete truth values
algebras (e.g. {0, 1}), super-consistent theories are consistent.
5.2 Examples of super-consistent theories
We have seen that the theories P −→ (Q ⇒ R) and P −→ (Q ⇒ P ) are
super-consistent, but that the theory P −→ (P ⇒ Q) is not. We give other
examples of super-consistent theory. In particular, we show that all the theories
that have been proved to have the strong normalization property in [5, 6] i.e.
arithmetic, simple type theory, the theories defined by a confluent, terminating
and quantifier free rewrite system, the theories defined by a confluent, terminat-
ing and positive rewrite systems and the theories defined by a positive rewrite
systems such that each atomic formula has at most one one-step reduct are
super-consistent. In this abstract, we detail only the case of simple type theory.
Definition 18 (Simple type theory). Simple type theory is a many-sorted
theory defined as follows. The sorts are inductively defined by ι and o are sorts
and if T and U are sorts then T → U is a sort. The language contains the
constants ST,U,V of sort (T → U → V ) → (T → U) → T → V , KT,U of sort
T → U → T , ⊤˙ of sort o and ⊥˙ of sort o, ⇒˙, ∧˙ and ∨˙ of sort o → o → o, ∀˙T
and ∃˙T of sort (T → o) → o, the function symbols αT,U of rank 〈T → U, T, U〉
and the predicate symbol ε of rank 〈o〉. The rules are
α(α(α(ST,U,V , x), y), z) −→ α(α(x, z), α(y, z))
α(α(KT,U , x), y) −→ x
ε(⊤˙) −→ ⊤
ε(⊥˙) −→ ⊥
ε(α(α(⇒˙, x), y)) −→ ε(x)⇒ ε(y)
ε(α(α(∧˙, x), y)) −→ ε(x) ∧ ε(y)
ε(α(α(∨˙, x), y)) −→ ε(x) ∨ ε(y)
ε(α(∀˙, x)) −→ ∀y ε(α(x, y))
ε(α(∃˙, x)) −→ ∃y ε(α(x, y))
Proposition 15. Simple type theory is super-consistent.

∀˜T (Range(a)),
ˆ˙
∃T = a 7→ ∃˜T (Range(a)) where Range(a) is the range of the
function a, is a B-valued model of simple type theory.
5.3 Normalization
We have seen that the theory P −→ (P ⇒ Q), that does not have the strong nor-
malization property, is consistent but not super-consistent, i.e. it has B-valued
models for some non trivial, full, ordered and complete truth values algebras B,
but not all. We prove now that, in contrast, all super-consistent theories have the
strong normalization property. To prove this, we build a particular full, ordered
and complete truth values algebra: the algebra of reducibility candidates.
We refer, for instance, to [5] for the definition of proof-terms, neutral proof-
terms and of proof-term reduction ⊲ and we define the following operations on
sets of proofs.
Definition 19. – The set ⊤˜ is the set of strongly normalizing proof-terms.
– The set ⊥˜ is the set of strongly normalizing proof-terms.
– If a and b are two sets of proofs-terms, then a ⇒˜ b is the set of strongly
normalizing proof-terms pi such that if pi reduces to λα pi1 then for every pi
′
in a, (pi′/α)pi1 is in b.
– If a and b are two sets of proof-terms, then then a ∧˜ b is the set of strongly
normalizing proof-terms pi such that if pi reduces to 〈pi1, pi2〉 then pi1 is in a
and pi2 is in b.
– If a and b are two sets of proof-terms, then a ∨˜ b is the set of strongly
normalizing proof-terms pi such that if pi reduces to i(pi1) (resp. j(pi2)) then
pi1 (resp. pi2) is in a (resp. b).
– If A is a set of sets of proof-terms, then ∀˜ A is the set of strongly normalizing
proof-terms pi such that if pi reduces to λx pi1 then for every term t and every
element a of A, (t/x)pi1 is in a.
– If A is a set of sets of proof-terms, then ∃˜ A is the set of strongly normalizing
proof-terms pi such that if pi reduces to 〈t, pi1〉, there exists an element a of
A such that pi1 is an element of a.
Definition 20 (Reducibility candidate). A set R of proof-terms is a re-
ducibility candidate if
– if pi ∈ R, then pi is strongly normalizable,
– if pi ∈ R and pi ⊲∗ pi′ then pi′ ∈ R,
– if pi is neutral and if for every pi′ such that pi ⊲1 pi′, pi′ ∈ R then pi ∈ R.
Proposition 16. The set of reducibility candidates is closed by the operations
of Definition 19.
Definition 21 (The algebra of reducibility candidates). The set B is the
set of reducibility candidates. The set B+ may be any set closed by intuitionistic
deduction rules, e.g. the set of all candidates. The sets A and E are ℘(B). The
operations are those of definition 19. The order ⊑ is inclusion.
Theorem 3 (Normalization). If the theory T ,≡ is super-consistent, then all
proofs strongly normalize in T ,≡.
Proof. Consider the full, ordered and complete truth values algebra B of re-
ducibility candidates. As it is super-consistent, the theory T ,≡ has a B-valued
model. This model is a reducibility candidate valued model of ≡ [5], called pre-
models there. Hence all proofs strongly normalize in T ,≡.
An alternative would be to define the set of candidates directly as the small-
est set of sets of proofs closed by the operations of definition 19 and arbitrary
intersections, like [12].
Notice that the pre-order ≤ is trivial and thus not antisymmetric. Hence, the
truth values algebra of reducibility candidates is not a Heyting algebra. The fact
that the choice of the set B+ is immaterial is due to the fact that B+ matters
for the interpretation of axioms but not for that of the congruence and cut
elimination is a property of the congruence of a theory, not of its axioms.
6 Conclusion
We have generalized the notion of Heyting algebra into a notion of truth values
algebra and proved that a theory is consistent if and only if it has a B-valued
model for some non trivial full, ordered and complete truth values algebra B.
Unlike Heyting algebra valued models, truth values algebra valued models allow
to distinguish computational equivalence from provable equivalence.
When a theory has a B-valued model for all full, ordered and complete truth
values algebras, it is said to be super-consistent and all proofs strongly normalize
in this theory. Proving strong normalization by proving super-consistency is
easier than proving strong normalization directly. For instance the proof that
simple type theory is super-consistent (Proposition 15) takes only a few lines.
All the technicalities related to the notion of reducibility candidate are now
hidden in the proof that super-consistency implies strong normalization and are
not used in the proof that the theory of interest is super-consistent.
The notion of super-consistency is a model theoretic sufficient condition
for strong normalization. It remains to understand if it also a necessary con-
dition or if some theories have the strong normalization property without being
super-consistent. To prove that strong normalization implies super-consistency,
we might need to restrict further the notion of super-consistency. For instance,
we have already restricted it by considering only ordered and complete truth
values algebras. Indeed, without such a completeness property, we could not use
the fixed point theorem to prove that the theory P −→ (⊥ ⇒ P ) had a B-
valued model for all B, and indeed, this theory does not have a T2-valued model.
Thus, the fact that the algebra of reducibility candidates, ordered by inclusion,
is complete seems to be an essential property that needs to be kept when ab-
stracting on reducibility candidates. It remains to understand if there are other
essential properties of candidates that need to be kept this way, so that strong
normalization may imply super-consistency.
