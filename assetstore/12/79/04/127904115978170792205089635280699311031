GROUPS PRESENTED BY FINITE TWO-MONADIC
CHURCH-ROSSER THUE SYSTEMS
J. AVENHAUS, K. MADLENER AND F. OTTO
Abstract. It is shown that a group G can be defined by a monoid-presentation of
the form (2; 7"), where T is a finite two-monadic Church-Rosser Thue system over
2, if and only if G is isomorphic to the free product of a finitely generated free
group with a finite number of finite groups.
Introduction. In 1911 M. Dehn formulated three fundamental problems for groups
given by presentations of the form (2; L), where 2 is some set of generators, 2 is a
disjoint copy of 2, and L ç (2 U 2)* is a set of defining relators [12]. One of these
problems is the word problem, which can be stated as follows: Let (2; L) be a
group presentation. Given a word w e (2 U 2)* decide in a finite number of steps
whether w defines the identity of the group presented by (2; L).
In 1955 W. W. Boone and P. S. Novikov independently proved that the word
problem for finitely presented groups is undecidable [8, 20]. Furthermore, each
sufficiently rich complexity class can be realized by the word problem for a finitely
presented group [1, 10]. However, since the property of having a 6-decidable word
problem for some complexity class 6 is a Markov property, it is undecidable in
general whether the group given by a presentation (2; L) has a 6-decidable word
problem [16]. In fact, it even is undecidable in general whether the group presented
by (2; L) is trivial, i.e., whether it is isomorphic to the trivial group (1) [22].
However, if the given presentation is of a restricted form only, then it may give some
information about the decidability and complexity of the word problem, e.g., if the
presentation contains a single defining relator only, then the word problem is
decidable [17], or if the presentation has the small cancellation property, then Dehn's
linear time algorithm for deciding the word problem may be applied [16].
Recently there has been much interest in term rewriting systems because of their
various applications to theorem proving, specification of abstract data types, pro-
gram transformation and synthesis (see e.g. [9] for an overview). A restricted class of
term rewriting systems are the so-called string rewriting systems, which actually are
semi-Thue systems. It is hoped that by investigating these restricted systems one gets
some insight into what can and what cannot be expected in the general situation [5].

On the other hand; string rewriting systems have been used very successfully to
provide efficient algorithms for some decision problems for monoids and groups
[4-7, 21]. For example, if a group G can be presented by a finite Church-Rosser
Thue system, then the word problem for G is decidable in linear time [4].
The classification of groups according to the complexity of their word problem
and the characterization of groups whose word problem may be solved by algo-
rithms of specific types have been studied extensively. Nevertheless there are only
few results of algebraic characterizations of groups whose word problems are of
certain complexities. One important result of this type is due to Müller and Schupp
[19]: Groups with context-free word problems are essentially the virtually free
groups, i.e., groups which have free subgroups of finite index. A subclass of these
groups, the ones with simple context-free word problems, has been characterized by
Haring-Smith[13].
Characterizations of groups that can be presented by rewriting systems satisfying
certain restrictions are also of great interest because these groups have algorithms
for solving the word problem which are directly derived from the presentations, and
because these characterizations show the limitation of the method of using certain
rewriting systems for solving word problems for groups. A very nice example of a
result of this kind is due to Cochet. In [11] he shows that a group G can be presented
by a finite special Church-Rosser Thue system iff G is isomorphic to a free product
of finitely many cyclic groups.
In [2] Avenhaus and Madlener prove that a group G can be presented by a finite
monadic Church-Rosser Thue system that provides inverses of length one to all the
generators if and only if G is isomorphic to a free product of a finitely generated
free group and finitely many finite groups. By coincidence this exactly is the class of
groups for which the reduced word problem is a simple language [13].
In this paper the result of Avenhaus and Madlener mentioned above is extended
to all finite monadic Church-Rosser Thue systems that have rules with left-hand side
of length two only. Since every Thue system can be reduced effectively, and since the
reduced forms of the Thue systems considered in [2] do have rules with left-hand
sides of length two only, the result given here is a real extension of the one given in
[2]. It is proved by reducing it to the one of [2], which is presented in §2 to make this
paper self-contained.
If T is a finite monadic Church-Rosser Thue system over 2, then each congruence
class [u]T is a deterministic context-free language [4]. Hence, if a group G can be
described by a finite presentation involving a monadic Church-Rosser Thue system,
then G is a context-free group in the sense of Müller and Schupp [19]. Thus, the
class of groups considered in this paper is a subclass of the class of context-free
groups.
1. Definitions and notations. An alphabet 2 is a finite set whose members are
called letters. The set of words over 2 is denoted by 2*, and 1 denotes the empty
word. In general, \x\ denotes the length of a word x, which is defined by |1| = 0,
\xa\ = |jc| + 1  for all ieP,  a e 2. For a e 2,  \w\a denotes the number of

occurrences of the letter a in w. The identity of words is written as = , and the
concatenation of words u and v is simply written as uv.
A Thue system T over 2 is a (not necessarily finite) subset of 2* X 2*. The
members of T are called (rewriting) rules. Given such a Thue system T over 2,
domain (T)= [l\3r e 2*: (/,r)e T), and range (T) = {r|3/G 2*: (/,/•) g T).
A Thue system T is called special if domain (T) ç 2* - {1}, and range (T) = {!),
and it is called monadic if all its rules are length-reducing, i.e., |/| > \r\ for all
(/,/•) g T, and range (T) Q 2 U {1}. Finally, it is called two-monadic, if it is
monadic, and domain (T) Q 22.
For a Thue system Tover 2, let «-» be the following relation: Vi/,i)eS*:««c

iff 3x, y G 2*, (/, r) G T: (u = xly and v = xry) or (w = xry and i; = xly). The*

Let M be a monoid. If M = 2*/ <->, i.e., if the monoids M and 2*/ <->  are
T T
isomorphic, then (2; T) is called a (monoid) presentation of M, 2 is the set of
generators, and T is the set of defining relations of this presentation.
Let T be a Thue system over 2. Suppose u, v G 2*, and u <-> t>. We write « -» u,
r r
if |h| > |u|. Then the Thue reduction defined by T is the reflexive and transitive
closure   -»   of   -». Since words cannot have negative length, this relation is

T).  If  «  has no descendant except itself, then it is irreducible, otherwise it is
reducible (modulo T). IRR^) denotes the set of all irreducible words (modulo T).
Monadic Thue systems have the following nice property.
Lemma 1.2. Let T be a monadic Thue system over 2, and let u,v,w g 2* such that
m m *

Hence, there are x, y g 2* and (/, r) e 7 with z s x/v and uw = xry. Now T
being monadic implies that \r\ < 1, and therefore r either belongs to v or to w.
Assume the first case, the other case being symmetric. Then v = xry,, and w = y2
with y = yxy2, and z = xly}y2. Thus, with z, s xlyx, and z2 = j2 we have that

z = zxz2, zx -» v, and z2 -» w. According to the induction hypothesis there exist «,,

It can be seen easily that in general Lemma 1.2 does not hold for nonmonadic
Thue systems.
A Thue system T over 2 is Church-Rosser if every two congruent words have a* * *
common descendant, i.e., «<->i;iff3wG2*: w->u> and v -» w.
T T T
Proposition 1.3. The Thue system T is Church-Rosser if and only if there exist no
two distinct irreducible words that are congruent (modulo T).
Since every word is congruent to some irreducible word this says that in a
Church-Rosser Thue system every congruence class contains exactly one irreducible
word.
Proposition 1.4. [4]. // T is a finite Thue system over 2 that is Church-Rosser,
then there exists a linear-time algorithm that on input a word u e 2* computes the
irreducible descendant of u.
*
Hence, if M = 2*/ «-»  is a monoid, where T is a finite Church-Rosser Thue
T
system, then the word problem for M is decidable in linear time, i.e., it is decidable
in linear time whether two words u, v g 2* represent the same element of M.
* m
Two Thue systems Tx and T2 over 2 are equivalent, if the congruences «-» and «-»
r, T2* *
coincide, i.e., for all u, v g 2*, u *-* v if and only if u «-> v. A Thue system rover 2
T, T2
is called reduced or normalized, if range (T) c IRR(T), and if / G IRR(T - {(/, /•)})
for all rules (/,/•) g T.
Proposition 1.5 [2, 14]. Let T be a finite Church-Rosser Thue system over 2. Then
one can effectively compute a finite Church-Rosser Thue system T' over 2 that is
reduced, and that is equivalent to T.
In particular, if the finite Church-Rosser Thue system T is special or monadic,
then the reduced Thue system T' is also special or monadic, respectively. Further, if
M s 2*/ «-» , where T is Church-Rosser and reduced containing a rule (a,l) for
T
some a g 2, then M is also described by the presentation (2 - {a}; T — {(a, 1)}).
Thus we may assume that a reduced Church-Rosser Thue system does not contain
rules of the form (a, 1) with a G 2, i.e., T C\ (2 X {1}) = 0.
Proposition 1.6. Let M = 2*/ «-» . Then the monoid M is actually a group iff
T
every letter a G 2 is invertible in M, i.e., there exist words ua, va G 2* with
au   «-» 1 «-» vaa.

Church-Rosser, then with uv -» 1 also vu -» 1.

Finitely generated free groups and finite cyclic groups can be presented by finite
special Church-Rosser Thue systems, namely (2+U 2_; {(ad, 1),(da,l)\a g 2 + })
and ({a); {(a",l))) represent the free group in the generators 2 and the cyclic
group of order n, respectively. Here 2^ is an alphabet in 1-1 correspondence with
2+, and the function ~: 2 + -> 2_ is realizing this correspondence. A presentation
for the free product of two groups is obtained by taking as generators the disjoint
union of the generators and as Thue system the disjoint union of the Thue systems
representing each group. So the free product of groups presented by finite special
Church-Rosser Thue systems has itself such a presentation. A characterization of all
groups presented by such systems is given by Cochet in [11].
Theorem 1.7 [11]. A group G can be presented by a presentation of the form (2; T),
where T is a finite, special, Church-Rosser Thue system iff G is the free product of
finitely many cyclic groups.
2. Thue systems all the generators of which have inverses of length one. Here we
want to characterize the groups that can be presented by presentations of the form
(2; T), where T is a finite monadic Church-Rosser Thue system such that for every
a g 2 some b g 2 exists with ab -» 1, i.e., all the generators in the given presenta-
T
tion (2;T) have inverses of length one.
Since the reduced form of a monadic Church-Rosser Thue system is itself monadic
and Church-Rosser, we can restrict our attention to reduced Thue systems.
Lemma 2.1. Let T be a finite monadic Church-Rosser Thue system over 2 such that
every element of 2 has an inverse of length one with respect to T. If T is reduced, then
TQ 22 X (2 U {1}).
Proof. Since T is reduced and monadic, we have |/| > 2 for every / e domain
(T). Now let (/, r) g T with I = az for some a g 2. Since every element of 2 has
an inverse of length one with respect to T, there is some b G 2 with ab -* 1, and
T* *
ba -» 1. In particular, (2; T) is a group, and therefore br «-> z. T being reduced
T T*
implies that z is irreducible, and hence br -* z. Thus, \br\ = 1 + \r\ > \z\.
If \r\ = 0, then \z\ = 1, and so |/| = 2.^If \r\ = 1, then |z| g {1,2}. If \z\ = 1,
then  |/| = 2, and if  \z\ = 2, then z = br implying I = az = abr. However, this
contradicts the assumption of T being reduced, since ab -» 1.   D
t
So the presentations considered here are of a very special form.
If a group G is finite, then its multiplication table is finite. So we get a monadic
presentation for G by taking for each element (=£ 1) of the group a letter and for
T = {(ab,c)\a ■ b = c). It is easy to see that this is a finite reduced monadic
Church-Rosser presentation for G.

So if a group G is finite or free, then G has a presentation of this special form. If
Gx and G2 have such presentations, then the free product Gx * G2 does so as well.
We will show that no other groups have such presentations, and by doing so we will
prove
Theorem 2.2. A group G can be presented by a presentation of the form (2; T),
where T is a finite, monadic, Church-Rosser Thue system such that every element of 2
has an inverse of length one with respect to T iff G is a free product of a finitely
generated free group and finitely many finite groups.
We will use a result of Haring-Smith [13] that is based on the work of Stallings
[23], and that gives a geometrical (language) characterization of groups which are
free products of free groups with finite groups. This characterization is based on the
Cayley diagram of a presentation of the group by generators and defining relations.
Suppose that 2 = 2 + U 2_, where 2_= {a\a g 2 + }, 2 + n 2_= 0, and let
R ç 2* X 2* be finite. Then the monoid 2*/ ¿  with T = RU {(aä,l), (âa,l)\
T
a G 2 +} is a group, and (2+; R) is a group presentation of this group [18].
Theorem 2.3 [13]. Let (2+; R) be a group presentation of a group G such that the
set M0 = {w G ( 2 + U 2_)*|w = 1 in G, but no proper segment of w is equal to 1 in
G ) is finite. Then G is a free product of a finitely generated free group with finitely
many finite groups.
We will use this theorem for our characterization by proving
Lemma 2.4. Given a finite monadic Church-Rosser Thue system T over 2 such that
every element of 2 has an inverse of length one with respect to T. Then the following set* *
M is finite: M = {w g 2 * | w «-+ 1, but no proper segment uofw satisfies u <-> 1}.
T T
Proof. Without loss of generality we may assume that T is reduced. For each
generator a g 2 denote by ä the inverse of length one of a.
Now we proceed by showing that each w G 2* with w «-» 1 contains a proper
T*
segment v satisfying v «-> 1, if \w\ > n := |2| + 2. Here |2| denotes the cardinality of
T
2.
Suppose that w = a, • • • a. «-» 1, where a,,..., a„ e 2, and let ui denote the
T *
irreducible descendant of the initial factor a, • • • a   of  w, i.e.,  a, • • • a ■ -> w,
T
(1 </<«). If |w,-| < 1 for all 1 < i < n, then there are /' and j, 1 < i <j < n, with
u, = u . Hence,
Of- a^Ul = Uj^Of ■■■ atai+f ■■■ aJt
* *
and so v = a,+ 1 • • • a. «-> 1, since 2*/ <-> is a group.j T T
Now assume there is some m  with \u.\ > 2. Since u    , = a , this implies that* *
lMy+il < \U¡\ f°r some j < n - 1. Of course, wy <-> uJ+1äj+l, and so «7+1äy + 1 -> uJt

since Uj is irreducible. Hence, \Uj\ < \uJ+1\ + 1 < \Uj\ + 1. Therefore, \uj\ = \uj+l\
+ 1, and Uj = uj+fäj+f. Thus, ax • • • aJ, -* uf = Uj+15J+1, and so there is some
A:, 1 <ifc<7, such that  a, * • * ak^uJ+v and  a¿+1 ••• aj-*äJ + 1. This follows
from Lemma 1.2. Hence, w contains the segment ak + l ■ ■ ■ ayaj+x -* äj+xaj+x -> 1.
D
Notice that Lemma 2.4 also holds for finite special Church-Rosser Thue systems T
without the assumption on the inverses of length one.
Now we can prove Theorem 2.2. Suppose that a group G is presented by a
presentation of the form (2; T). where T is a finite, monadic, Church-Rosser Thue
system such that every element of 2 has an inverse of length one with respect to T.
If we take 2 + := 2 and R := T, then G is isomorphic to the group C70 presented by
(2+; R). According to Lemma 2.4 the set M={wg2*|w<-»1, but no proper
*
segment u of w satisfies w <-> 1} is finite. Since in (2;T) each generator has an
T
inverse of length one, it is easy to see that with M also the set
M0= {w G (2 + U 2_)*|h>= lin G0,
but no proper segment of w is equal to 1 in G0}
is finite. Thus, Theorem 2.3 gives the intended result.
In the next section we will omit the condition that each generator in the
presentation (2; T) under consideration has an inverse of length one. However, in
order to be able to prove the intended characterization, we have to restrict our
attention to Thue systems all the rules of which have left-hand sides of length two.
3. Two-monadic Thue systems. If a finite monadic Church-Rosser Thue system T
over 2 is reduced, and if each generator a g 2 has an inverse of length one, i.e., if
for each a G 2 there is some b g 2 such that ab <-» 1, then the left-hand side of
each rule of T is of length two, i.e., T c 22 X (2 U {1}). On the other hand, a finite
Church-Rosser Thue system T Q 22 X (2 U {1}) can be reduced without having an
inverse of length one for each of the generators from 2, although 2*/ «-»  is a
T
group.
Example 3.1. Take 2 = {a, b, c), and T = {(a2, 1), (b2, 1),
(ab,c),(ac, b),(cb, a)). Then T is reduced, and T ç 22 X (2 U {1}). It can be
checked easily that T is Church-Rosser.
It is obvious that the generator c does not have an inverse of length one. However,
fbp -> a2 -> 1, and ¿pc,-> b2 -» 1, i.e., c is invertible, and hence, 2*/ <-> is a group.
T T T T T
Theorem 2.2 was proved by showing that the theorem of Haring-Smith can be
applied to a group-presentation (2; T), where T is a finite monadic Church-Rosser
Thue system that is reduced and that has inverses of length one for all the
generators. Now one may hope that this theorem can be applied also in the more
general situation, where T ç 22 X (2 u {1}) does not have inverses of length one
for all the generators.

Example   3.1   (continued).   caci-> cb -» a,   and   hence   cmacm <* a.   Thus,
T T T*
c"'ac"'a «-> 1. But no proper segment of cmac"'a is congruent to 1 modulo T. Hence,
T * *
the set A/={wg2*|w<->1, and no proper segment u of w satisfies u «-> 1} is
T T
infinite.
Thus, the theorem of Haring-Smith cannot be applied to every presentation
(2; T) defining a group, where T'ç22X(2u{l})is finite, reduced, and Church-
Rosser. To get around this difficulty one can try to introduce the missing inverses.
Example 3.1 (continued). Take 20 = 2 u {c}. Since c is to act as the inverse of
c, we need the rules (cc, 1) and (cc, 1). Take T0 = T U {(cc, 1), (cc, 1)). Now assume
that 2[ is a finite alphabet containing 20, and Tx is a finite Church-Rosser Thue* *
system containing T0 such that 2*/ <->  = 2f/ «-> , and when restricted to 2*, the
T 7\* *
congruences   «->   and   <->  coincide. Since b «- ccb -* ca, we have ca -» b. Hence,
T 7\ T0 T0 T,
ba «- ca2 -> c, and so ¿>a -» c. Notice that jc «-» 1 for all x G 20, since the con-
Tt        7-, r, r,* *
gruences «-» and <-> coincide on 2*.

Hence, there is some / g 2, u {1} such that (cb, f),(bc, f) g 7\. Thus,

and hence there is some g g 2, U {1} such that (c , g) g 7\. Since 2f/ <->   is a
group. Lemma 4 of [3] implies that c has finite order in 2f/ <-> . On the other hand,
2J"/ <^   is isomorphic to the free product G:= (a; a2)*(b; b2), and ordc(c) =
r' /
ordc(a/3) = 0, i.e., c has infinite order y\ .
Thus, when c is added, then no monadic Church-Rosser Thue system presenting
the group 2*/ <-» can be reached.
T
Another possible way is to try to get rid of all those generators that do not have
inverses of length one. As we will see in the following this can actually be done for
the presentation under consideration.
Theorem 3.2. Let T <z 22 X (2 U {1}) be a finite Church-Rosser Thue system
such that 2*/ «->   is a group. Then there exists a subset 2, of 2 such that the
T
following conditions are satisfied:
(1) each letter from 2, has an inverse of length 1;
(2) the Thue system Tx:= TO (22 X (2! U {1})) is Church-Rosser, and
(3) (2,; Tx) presents the same group as (2; T), i.e., 2f/ <->  £ 2*/ «-> .

Together with Theorem 2.2 this gives our main result.
Theorem 3.3. A group G has a presentation (2; T) such that T c 22 X (2 U {1})
is finite, and Church-Rosser iff G is a free product of a finitely generated free group
with finitely many finite groups.
It remains to prove Theorem 3.2. This proof is subdivided into several lemmata.
In the following let T ç 22 X (2 U {1}) denote a fixed finite Church-Rosser Thue
system such that G = 2*/ «-» is a group. Notice that T is reduced.
T
Now each generator from 2 can be classified according to the length of a
corresponding irreducible inverse.
Definition 3.4. For útg2 define X(a) = min{|w| \au -* 1).  Let 2, = {a g
2|X(a)-i}.
Since G is a group, we have 2 = U/>i2/, where 2, D 2y = 0 for /' # j. In
particular, 2, + 0, since T is two-monadic.
Lemma 3.5. Let i > 1, and let a G 2,. Then the set 2' n {u \ au -» 1} consists of a
T
single irreducible word ua from 2J.
Proof. Let a g 2, for some / > 1. Then according to the definition of 2,,
2'n {u | au -» 1} ç IRR(T), i.e., all the words in 2' n {u \ au -* 1} are irreducible.

Let ua = bx ■ ■ ■ b¡. Then for each letter ¿>, there is some letter b¡ g 2, such that_ _ _ _ _ * *

Now let m G 2J n { ü 11; «-> a}, i.e., « = c,• • • • c, with c1;..., c, G 2, such that

T
i.e., b, = c, for / = 1,..., /'. Hence, Lemma 3.5 gives b¡ = c, for /' = 1,..., /', i.e.,>      i        _ * /      v

Thus, the group G is generated by 2, already. For each letter a g 2l5 denote the
word Ma g 2j by ä, and for w = ax ■ ■ ■ ak g 2*, denote the word ak ■ ■ ■ a, by
w~x. Notice that for every ae2[ the rules (ad, 1) and (äa, 1) are in T.
Since we want to get rid of the generators from 2 — 2,, we define a mapping <p:
2 -» 2* and a subsystem 7\ of T as follows.
Definition 3.7. (i) For a g 2, let (p(a) = va g 2',.
(¡¡JTakeTj = Tn(22 X (2i U {1})), i.e., 7\ = {(/, r) G T|/,rG 2*}.
Because of Corollary 3.6 the mapping (¡d is well defined. It can be extended to 2*
in an obvious way.
Now we want to show that (2,; 7\) is a presentation of the group G such that
Theorem 2.2 applies to this presentation. However, before we can start with doing
so, we need to derive one further property of the system T.
Lemma 3.8. Let c g 2, for some i > 2, and let ax, a2, bx, b2 G 2j with (ûfa2, c),
(bxb2, c) G T. Then axa2 = bxb2.
Proof. We have axa2 -» c «- bxb2. Hence
_  _  T        T     _  _      ,
cb2bx «-» hxb2b2bx -» 1 <- axa2a2ax <^ ca2ax.
T T        T T
Since c G 2, for some / > 2, this implies that i = 2, and b2bf = c'x = â2âx. Hence
by Lemma 3.5, uf02 = bfb2.   □
Now we are ready to prove
Lemma 3.9. Tx is finite, monadic, and Church-Rosser.
Proof. Tx is finite and monadic, since it is a subsystem of T. It remains to prove
that 7, is Church-Rosser. For doing so, we have to check all the critical pairs of Tx.
So assume that (ab,d). (bc,f) G Tx with a,b,c G 2,, and d,/G 2, U {1}. This
gives the critical pair (de, af): de <- abc -* af._ r,        r, _
If í/ = 1 and / 5= 1, then a = b and c = b. Hence, dc = b = af.• *
If d = 1 and f G 2,, then dc = c <-» a/. But T, ç 7 implying c <-> af. Since T is
r, T
Church-Rosser, this means (af, c) G T, and so (af, c) G T,.

If d g 2, and / = 1, then (de, a) g Tx for similar reasons.
So assume ¿eS, and / g 2,. Now dc <-> af implies that dc <-> af, and since T is
7", 7
Church-Rosser, there is some g g 2 U {1} such that (de, g) G T and (a/, g) g T. If
g g 2, U {1}, then (de, g) g T, and (a/, g) g 7\. If g g 2, for some i > 2, then
Lemma 3.8 applies giving dc = af.
Thus, in every case the critical pair (dc, af) can be resolved in 7\. Hence, 7\ is
Church-Rosser.    D *
Obviously, in the monoid 2f/ *->  every generator has an inverse of length one.
7",
*
In particular,  2,*/ «-»   is a group, and therefore Theorem 2.2 applies to this
7i
presentation. Hence, we have
*
Corollary 3.10. The group 2f/ <->  is a free product of a finitely generated free
7,
group with finitely many finite groups.
In order to prove Theorem 3.2 it only remains to show that the mapping <p defines* *
an isomorphism from 2*/ «-» onto 2f/ <-» . Obviously, m is onto, since y(a) = a
T 7,* *
for all  a g 2,.  Further, if tp(vv) «-» 1  for some w G 2*, then ep(u>) <-» 1, since
7, T* *
Tf Q T. But <p(w) «-> w according to the definition of <p, and so w «-> 1. Thus, if <p is
7 7
indeed a homomorphism from 2*/ «-»   in 2f/ «-» , then qp is an isomorphism.
7 7;
Therefore, we have to show that <p(ab) *-» <p(c) for all rules (ab, c) g T. For this we

need one further lemma.

Now we can start to investigate the relation between cp(ab) and q>(c) for rules
(ab, c) g T. Several cases have to be distinguished depending on which of the letters
a, b, c are in 2j and which are not. For w g 2*, let |w|s := 2a e 2 |w|a, i.e., |w|2 is
the number of occurrences of letters from 2, in w.
Lemma 3.12. Let (ab,c) G T with |a6c|2 > 2. Then <p(ab) -» <p(c).1 7-1
Proof, (i) If a,b,c & 2,, then (<a6, c) g T,, and so <p(ab) = ab -> c = <p(c).
7,
(ii) If a, 6 g 2j, and c g 2 - 2,, then c g 22, and vc = a6 according to Corollary
3.6. Thus, <p(ab) = ab = <p(c).
(iii) If a, c G 2,, and b G 2 — 2,, then (a¿>, c) G T implies (äc, b) g T. From (ii)
we conclude that <p(b) = 5c. Hence, <p(ab) = aäc -> c = <p(c).
7,
(iv) If A, c g 2,, and a g 2 - 2i5 then (ab,c) g T implies (cb,a) g 7T Hence,
<jp(a) 5= c¿, and so <p(aft) = ebb -» c = qp(c).   D
7,
Lemma 3.13. Lei (a6, c) G T wirft a g 2,, o g 2x, and c g 2 • /or some i, j > 2.
Then \i - j\ < 1, and <p(ab) -» <p(c).
7,
Proof. Since a g 2,, we have a"1 = a, • • • a, g 2f, and <p(a) = va =■ a¡ • • • ô",,
and c g 2  implies c~x = cx - - - c g 2f, and <p(c) = n = c  • • • c,.
Since 2*/ «-» is a group, ab «-» c implies ¿>ö, • • • a, = (ab)'x ++ c~x = cx ■ ■ ■ c ,
7 7 7
and a, • • • <a( = a"1 <-» ¿Cj • • • c . Now c e 2 , and hence j < í + 1. On the other
hand, a g 2, implying /' <_/' + 1. Thus, |; — j\ < 1. Now, three cases must be
distinguished.
(i) j = i — 1: (ab,c) G T and o G 2, imply (ce, a) g T. Hence,
a, • • • a, 5 a-1 <-> (c£)~  = Z/c, • ■ ■ c,_,.
7
But a, ■ • • a, is irreducible, and so a, • • • a, = oc, • • ■ c,_,. Thus,
<p(a¿>) - <p(a)<p(b)
= a, ■ ■ ■ äfb
- c¡-\ ■■■ Cfbb^c,_f ■■■ ëf
7,
= <p(c).
(ii) j = /': (ab, c) G T implies that
büf ■ ■ ■ a¡= (ab)    «-» c"1 = c, • • • c,.
7
Since c, • • ■ c, as well as a, ■ • • a¡ are irreducible, this means that (bOf, c,) g T and
aA 5= cx for X = 2,..., /'. Hence, (oa,, c,) g 7",, and so (äfb, c,) g Tv Thus,
<p(ao) 5= a,, ■ • • äfb -> ä, • • ■ â2c, = c,. • ■ • cx =s <p(c).

A symmetric lemma can be proved accordingly.
Lemma 3.14. Let (ab,c) g T with a G 2,, o G 2,, awd c G 2  /or 50/ne /', j > 2.
Then \i — j\ < 1, and <p(ab) -» <p(c).
7i
It remains to consider those rules (ab,c) G T for which a and 6 both are in
2 - 2,. To handle these rules, we need
Lemma 3.15. Let u, v g 2f be irreducible modulo T, and let c, d G 2, such that* *
udv —* c. Then udv —> c.
7 7,
Proof. Since u and u are irreducible modulo T, the reduction udt) -> c is of the
T
following form:
udv = u0d0v0 -* «i^ü, -»...-» î^dV^ -» c,
T T T T
where in each step the words u¡, v,-G 2f are irreducible, and one of the following
three conditions is met:
(i) m, + 1 = w„ Vi = f,vl+l with /, g 2,, and (t/,/„ di+1) G T with dI+1 g 2,
(ii) vi+l = v¡, u, = M,+1g, with g, g 2X, and (g,</„ di+1) g T with dI+1 g 2,
(iii) u¡ = ul+fgi, v, = />,.+1 with g,,/, g 21; and ((g,d„l) g T and <//+1 s /. or
W/„l)6rand(i/+1«^
Thus, in each step the rule applied is of the form (ab, c) with a G 2, or b g 2,.
Hence, <p(ab) -* <p(c) for every rule applied during this reduction according to
Ti
Lemmas 3.12-3.14. Therefore, we have for each i = 0,..., k - 1:
*
<p(«,d>,) ■ u¡<f(d,)v¡^ u¡+f<p(di+f)vl + 1
- V("i+i¿m0/+i).
and so
*
«du 5= <p(«0d0f;0) -> (p(c) = C.     D
7,
Now we are ready to deal with the remaining rules that are of the form (ab,c)
with a g 2,, and b g 2, for some /', / > 2.
Lemma 3.16. Lei (ab, c) G T w/i/i a G 2„ è G 2; w/'í/i /', y > 2, a/id c g 2,. Then
<p(ab) -» rf(c).
Proof. Since a g 2;, we have a-1 = Oj • • • a,- e 2f, and <p(a) = ô", • • • â,. Since
è g 2y, b~x = bf ■■■ bp and ç»(6) * 5,. • • ■ 5^

But bx ■ ■ ■ b: and ax ■ ■ ■ ai are irreducible. Hence 6, • • • 6 a, • • • a- -* c according

according to Lemma 3.11.   D *
Thus, we have shown so far that <p(ab) -* q>(c) for all rules (ab,c) G T with
7,
|a6c|2 > 1. Hence, the proof of Theorem 3.2 is completed by
Lemma 3.17. Let (ab, c) g Twith a g 2,, b g 2,, ande G 2k for some i, j, k > 2.
Then <p(ab) -* <p(c).
7-,
Proof. Let a~x = ax ■■■ a¡ g 2f, b~x = è, • • • b¿ g 2f, and c'x = c, • • • ck g
2f. Now (ab, c) g T implies that
6, • • • Z> a, • • • a,■= (ab)'1 ^ c'1 = c, • • • c^.
7
The word cL • • • ck is irreducible, and so o, • • • ô-aj • • • a, -* c, • • • ck. But
bf ■ ■ ■ bj and a, ■ • • a¡ are irreducible as well. Hence there are / and m such that
bi ■•■ b,_f = Cf ■■■ c,_f, b,--- bjüf ■■■ am-*c„ and am+1 • • • a, = c/+1 • • • ck.
Now c, g 2,, and b¡ ■ ■ ■ bj as well as a, • • • am are irreducible. Thus, Lemma 3.15

Lemma 3.18. The mapping <p defines an isomorphism from the group 2*/ «-» onto

This proves Theorem 3.2.
4. Concluding remarks. Theorem 3.2 may be used to prove a lot of algebraic and
algorithmic properties for the class of groups presented by two-monadic reduced
Church-Rosser Thue systems. For instance, by Kurosch's Theorem [16, 18] this class
is subgroup-closed, i.e., finitely generated subgroups are also presented by two-

GROUPS PRESENTED BY CHURCH-ROSSER THUE SYSTEMS 441
monadic reduced Church-Rosser Thue systems. In addition, centralizers of elements
are cyclic or finite groups.
Free products of a finitely generated free group with finitely many finite groups
have nice algorithmic properties, i.e., the conjugacy problem, the root problem, the
power problem, the order problem, and other problems are easily solvable. At first
sight it is not clear at all how to solve these problems without using the characteriza-
tion theorem, i.e., by using only properties of monadic Church-Rosser Thue systems.
Nevertheless, Theorem 2.3 is effective in the following sense: Given M0 it is possible
to effectively construct a presentation for G as a free product of a finitely generated
free group with finitely many finite groups. Since M0 is effectively constructible we
may construct a presentation for G as a free product from a given monadic
presentation for G and then apply the usual algorithms in free products for solving
problems like the conjugacy problem.
Notice that the type of presentations considered here leads to efficient algorithms
for solving the word problem, but this may happen at the expense of the size of the
presentation: For finite groups a presentation by a reduced monadic Church-Rosser
Thue system providing inverses of length one for the generators is actually the
multiplication table representation.
It is conjectured that the class of groups which can be presented by monadic
Church-Rosser Thue systems is exactly the class considered in this paper. The
question arises of whether this same proof technique can be applied in the general
case. Our first observation is that such Thue systems do exist.
Example. Take 2 = {a,b,c,d), and T= {(abc,l),(ca,d),(db,l),(bd,l)}.Then
T is monadic, reduced, and Church-Rosser. Obviously, the generators 6 and d are
invertible.   Further,   abc -» 1,   and   bpa*-* bd-» 1,   i.e.,   a   is   invertible,   and
.cab -» db -* 1, i.e., c is also invertible. Hence, 2*/ <-* is a group,i—i   T       T T
Can the technique used to prove Theorem 3.2 be applied to Thue systems of this
form? One difficulty consists in determining the generators that shall be kept.
Example (continued). 2, = {6,a"}, and 22 = {a,c}. Now 2f n IRR(r) =
(b'\i > 0} U {d'' \i > 1}. Further, each w g 2f can be reduced to an irreducible
w e 2J\ Thus, there is no w e 2j* such that a «-» w or c «-» w, i.e., the generators
7 7
from 22 cannot be expressed as words over 2j. And obviously, (2,; T n (2f x 2j*))
presents the group Fx, which is not isomorphic to the group 2*/ «-» s F2, where F¡
T
is the free group on /' generators.
Thus, if this technique should work at all, then the partition of the set of
generators 2 must be chosen in a different way. One such way is the following.
Definition. Let T be a finite, reduced, monadic, Church-Rosser Thue system
over 2 such that 2*/ «-» is a group, and T contains rules with left-hand sides of
T
length greater than two. For a e 2, define i(a):= min{k\3ua g 2*: a • ua -» 1}.
TakeS,- {a e 2|/(a) -/}.
Notice that for a Thue system the rules of which have left-hand sides of length two
only, this new definition coincides with the one given in 3.4.

442 J. AVENHAUS. K. MADLENER AND F. OTTO
Since 2*/ «-> is à group, the Thue system Tcontains rules of the form (u, 1), and
T
thus, 2, # 0. Obviously, 2, n 2y = 0 for /' *j. Further, 2,+1 # 0 implies that
2, =£ 0 as can be seen easily. Now we return to our example.
Example (continued). 2 = (a, 6, c, d), and T = {(a6c, 1), (ca, d),
(db,l),(bd,l)}. Hence 2X = {a,6,d},and 22 = {c}.
Each word w G 2* can be reduced to an irreducible w g 2*. Thus, there is no
w g 2f such that c «-» w, i.e., again we cannot express the generators from 22 as
words over 2,.
So the question of whether the technique developed in §3 can be applied to Thue
systems that do have rules with left-hand sides of length greater than two remains
open. If it applies, one has to find a different way of partitioning the given set of
generators; if not, one has to find a new technique in which new letters are
introduced to deal with Thue systems of this form that present groups.
