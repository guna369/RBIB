Go bak to An-fang, the Peae Square at An-Fang, the Beginning Plae at An-Fang, where
all things start (. . . ) An-Fang was near a ity, the only living ity with a pre-atomi name
(. . . ) The headquarters of the People Programmer was at An-Fang, and there the mistake
happened : A ruby trembled. Two tourmaline nets failed to retify the laser beam. A
diamond noted the error. Both the error and the orretion went into the general omputer.

Introdution : alternative titles
A purely interative approah to logi
A Interative B ould suggest yet-one-more-game-semantis : but the material presented here
is neither syntax nor semantis, moreover the word purely suggests a distane with the mere
idea of game : there is no rule or no referee, if you prefer like in real life. And logi,
without A s B, is for what should be the most natural thing in nature something too often
presented as the most artiial one.
The monograph ends with a ditionary, disussing these issues : sort of nal introdution,
sine one an only introdue to known material. For instane if you go to dialetis you
will understand the word
Ludis
whih is the real alternative title, the very name of the new area.
The novelty of ludis is onveyed by our title
Lous Solum
after the book by Raymond Roussel, Lous Solus, i.e., A solitary plae B. Lous Solum means
something like
Only the loation matters
for the results presented here establish the pregnany of loation, the lous, in logi. As you
will see, the irruption of the lous by no way weakens or dilutes logial priniples : they just
beome dierent, more harmonious, and stronger. Moreover the logi-we-used-to-know-and-
love is still present, but it now gets a spei name, spiritual logi : ludis reated spiritual
logi in the same way Brouwer reated lassial logi and Luther atholiism.
The monograph below has been oneived as the projet of giving reasonable foundations to
logi, on the largest possible grounds, but not with the notorious redutionist onnotation
usually attahed to A foundations B. Lous Solum would like to be the ommon playground
of logi, independent of systems, syntaxes, not to speak of ideologies. But wideness of sope
is nothing here but the reward of sharpness of onern : I investigate the multiple aspets of a
Jean-Yves Girard 4
single artifat, the design. Designs are not that kind of syntax-versus-semantis whores that
one an reshape aording to the humour of the day : one annot tamper with them, period.
But what one an ahieve with them, one their main properties separation, assoiativity,
stability have been understood, is out of proportion with their seemingly banal denition.
One last word : this book has been written during the year 2000, the year of ommemorative
frenzy. So let me review last entury, from the viewpoint of logial foundations.
1900-1930, the time of illusions : Naive foundational programs, like
Hilbert's, refuted by G√∂del's theorem.
1930-1970, the time of odings : Consisteny proofs, monstrous ordinal notations, ad
ho odings, a sort of voluntary bureaurati self-punishment.
1970-2000, the time of ategories : From the mid sixties the renewal of natural dedu-
tion, the Curry-Howard isomorphism, denotational semantis, system F . . . promoted
(with the deisive input of omputer siene) an approah in whih the objets looked
natural and reasonably free from foundational anguish.
Proof-theory started as a justiation of the rules of logi, as they were given to us, lassial
logi. The rules beame in turn an objet of study, induing their own logi, whih is not
the original (lassial) one. Intuitionisti logi, and later linear logi, not to speak of ludis
are part of this logi of rules. . . whene the subtitle :
From the rules of logi to the logi of rules.

LOCUS SOLUM 5
1. Designs
We rst onstrut the onrete objets logi is made of. These objets alled designs
play the role devoted to proofs, -terms, et., in usual syntax, and to funtions, liques, et.,
in denotational semantis, and even to lassial models to a reasonable extent.
1.1. Loations
The material in this setion (up to terminology) is idential with similar material in (Girard,
2000).
1.1.1. Biases and loi The basi analytial artifats (designs) are loated A somewhere B.
We shall therefore build a system of loations. A design D roughly represents a ut-free
proof of some formula A, in whih all logial information has been erased : only loations
are kept. If A has been loated at the empty sequene hi, then any formula ourring in the
proof is a subformula of A : it has a preise loation in the subformula tree of A. W.l.o.g.
we an assume that the number of immediate subformulas of any formula B is at most
denumerable, and we an name the various immediate subformulas of B as B0; B1; B2; : : :
The natural numbers 0; 1; 2; : : : whih distinguish the immediate subformulas of B are alled
biases ; when we translate syntax, their hoie is stritly arbitrary, no triky oding at work.
For instane, the three immediate
1
subformulas of the formula
A = ((P
?
Q
?
)
R
?
) of subsetion 1.2.1, p. 6, will be distinguished by the biases 3; 4; 7,
but we ould have hosen as well 9; 6; 22. An address (or lous) in the tree is therefore a
sequene of biases. Let us formalise these denitions :
Denition 1 (Loi). A bias is a natural number, notation i; j; k : : : A ramiation is a
nite set of biases, notation I; J;K; : : : A lous, or address, is a sequene hi
1
; : : : ; i
n
i of
biases, notation ; ; ;  : : :. The parity of a lous is dened as the parity of its length n.
Hene h3; 3; 8i is odd, whereas its immediate sublous h3; 3; 8; 0i is even. I shall follow the
usual onventions for onatenation, in partiular   i instead of   hii ; sometimes (esp.
in gures to save spae) I shall even use use i.    is alled a sublous of , strit when
 6= hi, immediate when  = hii. If two loi are inomparable, they are disjoint , i.e., they
have no ommon sublous. Finally the notation   I is short for f  i; i 2 Ig.
Ramiations are needed beause of multipliative rules, involving two (and through foal-
isation any nite number of) subformulas at the same time. Sine subloi orrespond to
subformulas, and a proof proeeds from its onlusion
2
, a lous ours A before B its subloi
(time relation). When two loi are inomparable, their relation is spatial, i.e., they are om-
pletely independent.
The following expressions will be introdued later : diretory for a set of ramiations,
reservoir for a set of biases, nite or innite.
1
The notion of immediate subformula is ombined with foalisation : here two steps are allowed, up to the
hange of polarity.
2
Cut-elimination also proeeds from the onlusion. By the way, this is the only possibility, espeially in
the absene of axioms, whih will be the ase in ludis.
Jean-Yves Girard 6
1.1.2. Pithforks Sine we are representing ut-free proofs, we must onsider some sort of
sequents . Although linear logi systematially used one-sided sequents `  , one an as well
use two-sided sequents made of positive formulas (typially, ` M;P;Q, with M negative,
P;Q positive is replaed with M
?
` P;Q, whih only ontains positive formulas). Foali-
sation makes it possible to restrit to sequents with at most one formula on the left ; these
are in fat the familiar intuitionisti sequents, with left and right exhanged sine it is more
natural to work with positive formulas
3
. Pithforks orrespond to what remains of sequents
when we only remember loations.
Denition 2 (Pithforks). A pithfork is an expression  `  where
Inomparability :  and  are nite sets of loi, pairwise disjoint ; in partiular a lous
in  and a lous in  are disjoint.
Handle and tines :  ontains at most one lous, the handle, the loi in  being the tines.
Eah pithfork reeives a polarity : a handless pithfork (a A omb B) is positive, a pithfork
with a handle being negative ; in partiular the empty pithfork is positive. A pithfork is
atomi when it ontains exatly one address, i.e., is of the form `  or  `.
In pratie, pithforks always satisfy an additional ondition :
Paritarism : The loi in  have the same parity, opposite to the parity of the handle (if
this makes sense).
Typially all pithforks ourring in a design of atomi base are paritary : this is beause
all rules involved in designs preserve paritarism. Paritary pithforks reeive a parity, namely
that of the tines and/or the parity opposite to the handle, with only one ambiguous ase,
the empty pithfork, whih reeives both parities. Paritarism plays no speial role in the
theory, but an be used as a sort of type-heker.
From the interative standpoint, the parities orrespond to two (essentially isomorphi)
players, Even and Odd. Rules (see denition 3, p. 8) orrespond to moves of the players :
for instane a proper rule of even fous is a move of Even. In the paritary ase, the fous of
the rule is on the left (i.e., of dierent parity) or on the right (same parity) depending the
onluding pithfork has a handle (negative) or not (positive) ; polarity an therefore be seen
as relative parity : negative means A dierent parity B and positive means A same parity B. . .
or in game-theoreti terms A you start B, A I start B. See the more detailed disusion in
subsetion 3.2.3.
Pithforks are handled with the usual onventions of sequent alulus :  ; is short for
the (disjoint) union   [ , and singletons are replaed with their unique element, so that
 `  ;;  is short for fg `   [ [ fg, and this impliitly means that the sets fg; ;
and fg are disjoint.
1.2. Designs as dessins
1.2.1. From proofs to designs Designs are proofs written in sequent alulus, or rather the
loative struture of a proof in sequent alulus, a sort of proof in A pithfork alulus B. To
understand how things work, let us take a onrete example, namely the positive formula
A = ((P
?
Q
?
) 
 R
?
), where P;Q;R are positive (so that the immediate subformulas of
A modulo foalisation are P
?
; Q
?
; R
?
). The rules for A are
3
Remember that intuitionisti logi is mainly based on negative operations, );^; 8.
LOCUS SOLUM 7
` ; P;R ` ; Q;R
(A`ffP;Rg;fQ;Rgg)
A ` 
P `   R ` 
(`A;fP;Rg)
`  ;; A
Q `   R ` 
(`A;fQ;Rg)
`  ;; A
The right rules are obtained by ombining a right Tensor-rule with one of the two possible
right Plus-rules and negation, yielding two possibilities distinguished as (` A; fP;Rg) and
(` A; fQ;Rg) ; the left rule is obtained by ombining the Par-rule with the With-rule and
negation. The rule is written (A ` ffP;Rg; fQ;Rgg) in order to stress the existene of two
premises, one involving P;R, the other involving Q;R.
The basi idea of designs is to forget everything but loations. So assume that the lous of
A is  and that P;Q;R respetively orrespond to the (distint !) biases 3; 4; 7, then we an
rewrite our rules as :
4
` ; 3; 7 ` ; 4; 7
( `ff3;7g;f4;7gg)
 ` 
3 `   7 ` 
(`;f3;7g)
`  ;; 
4 `   7 ` 
(`;f4;7g)
`  ;; 
The example learly shows how to translate essential parts of a proof, but says nothing as to
the identity axiom. Indeed the identity axiom A ` A is redued by means of -expansion to
atomi identity axioms p ` p, but, sine the proofs we have in mind are in fat universally
quantied w.r.t. p, the -expansions never stop. To make the long story short, no spei
rule is needed to onstrut the faxes whih orrespond to identity axioms.
The examples of pithfork rules just shown are indeed enough to represent any known logial
inferene. But this is not enough, we need a Joker, i.e., a rule that one an always apply.
This rule, alled Daimon, has the value of an axiom, an arbitrary one. It is restrited to
positive pithforks (simply beause its negative version is of no use). Syntatially it an be
seen as a mistake of logi (I annot prove `  , so I admit it !), but this is a A good B mistake,
whih is absolutely needed to get enough A proofs B (enough designs) with good properties.
We are now in position to dene designs, but the real denition is rather diult to grasp.
In Frenh, the two words dessein (= design, plot et.) and dessin (= drawing, piture et.)
sound the same, and this is why
F We rst dene a slightly inorret notion, designs-dessins, whih are basially the A proof-
trees B onstruted with our rules.
F Sine these dessins ontain irrelevant information we then give the real denition of
designs-desseins.
F In pratie, no partiular are is needed, i.e., results will usually be stated for the orret
notion of design-dessein and proved with the help of the friendlier designs-dessins.

1.2.2. Dessins
Denition 3 (Designs-dessins). A design is a proof-tree made of pithforks. The last
pithfork of the design is alled the onlusion or base. Eah pithfork ourring in the
design is the onlusion of a unique rule among those given below. The possible rules fall
into three ategories :
Daimon :
z
` 
(1)
Positive rule : I is a ramiation, for i 2 I the 
i
are pairwise disjoint and inluded in
 : one an apply the rule (nite, one premise for eah i 2 I)
: : :   i ` 
i
: : :
(`;I)
` ; 
(2)
Negative rule : N is a set of ramiations, the diretory of the rule, for all I 2 N , 
I
  :
one an apply the rule (perhaps innite, one premise for eah I 2 N )
: : : ` 
I
;   I : : :
( `N )
 ` 
(3)
 is alled the fous of the rules (` ; I) and ( ` N ). Sine I is a ramiation and N is a
set of ramiations, the symbol ` in the name of the rule is redundant, exept for the ase
I = N = ;, and we an omit it without reating impossible onfusions : we simply write
(; I) or (;N ). The three rules disovered in subsetion 1.2.1, p. 6, are therefore written
(; f3; 7g), (; f4; 7g) and (; ff3; 7g; f4; 7gg).
Our rules are in fat a ombination of the usual linear rules and weakening ; strit linearity
would fore  =
S

i
in the positive ase, and  = 
I
in the negative ase. If suh mistakes
have been allowed, this must be asribed to the mysteries of interativity : typially the
separation theorem 2, p. 26, or the projetion theorem 19, p. 49, make a heavy use of
A weakening B.
Remark 1. No assumption of niteness, well-foundedness, reursivity, is made ; designs
an therefore be badly innite. However innite designs an naturally be approximated by
means of nite designs : antiipating on designs-as-desseins, the inlusion D  E means that
E has been obtained by A adding B extra premises to the negative rules of D, hene any
design E is the direted union of nite designs E
i
, obtained by restriting all negative rules
of E to nite diretories, all but a nite number of them being empty.
1.2.3. Some basi designs
Example 1. The design
z
` 
(4)
is alled the daimon and noted Dai.
When ` ;  is positive, the rules z and (` ; ;) have quite the same premises, but they
must be distinguished. The rule z, whih has no fous, is onsidered as a positive rule,
but an improper one. We shall use the expression proper design to mean a design distint
LOCUS SOLUM 9
from the daimon, whih, in ase of a positive base, means that the rst rule of the design is
proper. By the way observe that there is only one design of base `, namely the daimon.
What follows is the most basi example of a design, namely the fax.
Example 2. If  and 

(5)
The fax relates two ourrenes of the same formula A, one loated in , the other loated in

0
. Sine the two A are intended to be subformulas of the impliation A √ÜA, one ourring
positively, the other ourring negatively, one understands that the loations are usually of
opposite parities
5
; it is more orret to rename the A to the right as A
0
. The atual meaning
of the fax omes from the fat that it behaves w.r.t. normalisation as the identity funtion
(see example 11) of A, better, the isomorphism between A and A
0
, orresponding to the
A deloation B whih exhanges   with 
0
. In terms of down-to-Earth game semantis,
the fax is nothing but the ludi version of the familiar opyat strategy. The expression
A fax B emphasises the deloation.
We said that the fax is the identity axiom, and this is true whether A is atomi or not. But
for non-atomi A, typially the formula of subsetion 1.2.1, p. 6, we have another possibility,
namely -expansion. If we translate the proof of A ` A
0
ending with -expansion, we instead
obtain the pseudo-fax :

replaes the full }
f
(N), i.e., most premises of the last rule have been severed ; in terms of des-
seins, see below, the pseudo-fax is a subset of the fax. In terms of syntax, fax and pseudo-fax
both orrespond to -expansions of the identity axioms. The dierene is that the pseudo-fax
is relative to a spei formula, whereas the fax is generi, i.e., works for any formula.
Whether they are the same or they are dierent, more preisely in whih sense they are/aren't
the same belongs to the theory of subtyping and inarnation, to be developed later.
Denition 4. If the pithfork  `  ours in the design D, then the subtree E indued
by D A above B  `  is a design of base  ` , that we all a subdesign of D.
Typially the designs Fax

are subdesigns of Fax
;

. The notion of subdesign has noth-
ing to do with inlusion or preedene.

However if we form a net of faxes, paritarism annot be ensured, see remark 3, p. 16.
Jean-Yves Girard 10
1.3. Designs as desseins
1.3.1. Introdution to desseins Observe that there is (with dessins) a problem, namely that
the name of a positive rule (` ; I) does not tell us in whih way the ontext splits. You
ould say : A let us mention it in the name of the rule B, and by the way this was the
solution taken in (Girard, 2000). Unfortunately, there is no way to reognise this splitting
interatively, i.e., by duality
6
.
Let us onsider an example :
Example 4.
(2;;)
2 ` 30
(;f2g)

z

3 ` 
z
` 
(7;f;g)
7 ` 
(;f3;7g)
` ; ; 
The last positive rule A gives B  to 3 and  to 7. Would it be possible to dispath the
ontext dierently ? Of ourse, sine the positive rule (` ; f2g) is performed on the branh
indexed by 3, one ould hardly give  to 7, but what about  , who has been given to 7, and
whih is passive ? Indeed the dessins

(;f3;7g)
` ; ; 
oer equally valid dispathings of the ontext. So to speak  is in between 3 and 7, perhaps
nowhere.
To be short, the splitting of the ontext is a onvenient deorative (dessin = piture) feature,
whih only makes sense for those loi in the ontext that are used as foi of positive rules.
What is funny is that this use destroys the lous (it is no longer there), what we all loation
post mortem. So designs should be onsidered up to this basi ambiguity : this leads to
desseins.
Let us onsider the dessin of example 4, p. 10 : we replae the tree with another one, roughly
of the same shape :
6
Conretely the separation theorem 2, p. 26, works for desseins, not for dessins.

The preise idea is to replae in the tree any negative pithfork  `  whih is the onlusion
of rule (;N ) with several opies, one for eah I 2 N , renamed as (; I) : this essentially
makes negative branhings our one step below. Eah positive pithfork is renamed after
the rule with that onlusion.
If we interpret the examples 5, p. 10, and 6, p. 10, we get the same tree, whih is the ommon
underlying dessein. As an illustration, let us try with the fax, i.e., example 2, p. 9 :

This dessein is not a tree, sine it has no root. Observe that the repetitive pattern is even
more onspiuous than in the dessin. Let us now look at the pseudo-fax of example 3, p. 9 :

This dessein is just the subset of the previous one restrited to the initial values
I = f3; 7g; I = f4; 7g.
Remark 2. The irrelevane of  is related to weakening , i.e., to the rule
`  
`  ; A
(8)
in whih the ontextA (the lous of ) is destroyed (if we look at the proofs from onlusion to
premises, or in terms of normalisation). The reader may ask why weakening is not forbidden
from the very start.
1 The forbidding of weakening is only neessary in the absene of polarisation, for want
of linearity, see the ritial pair of Lafont, whih does not make sense in a polarised
universe.
Jean-Yves Girard 12
2 Weakening is essential in the proof of internal ompleteness of the tensor produt.
The question whether or not weakening is now a fully respetable rule is beyond the sope
of this monograph.
However, the irrelevane of  annot be fully asribed to weakening. Typially in the logial
proof

whih does not use weakening, A ould as well be given to the right premise :

1.3.2. Desseins In what follows we x a pithfork  ` , that we shall all the base.
Denition 5 (Chroniles). A proper ation is a triple (; ; I) onsisting of a polarity
 = 1, a fous  (i.e., a lous) and a ramiation I . There is also an improper ation,
namely the Daimon (+1;z), positive.
In what follows A proper ation B means an ation  whose fous  is a sublous of a
(neessarily unique) lous of the base  2  (resp.  2 ), and polarity is +1 if the parities
of ;  are the same (resp. opposite),  1 if the parities of ;  are opposite (resp. the same)
7
.
In pratie we never indiate the polarity of an ation and simply write (; I)
8
or z.
A hronile of base  `  is a non-empty sequene of ations h

Negative ations : A negative fous 

where (

We use the Gothi letters ; d; e: : : to denote hroniles. We use the expression subhronile
to denote the restrition of a hronile.
Denition 6 (Coherene). The hroniles ;

When the base is paritary, the polarity of the ation is therefore the relative parity of  and the base.

This notation is ambiguous in the ase of ut-nets, sine the same ation may our twie, one positively,
one negatively.
LOCUS SOLUM 13
Arboresene : D is losed under restrition, in other terms it is a forest.
Coherene : The hroniles of D are pairwise oherent.
Positivity : If  2 D has no extension in D, then its last ation is positive.
Totality : If the base is positive, then D is non-empty.
A design is positive or negative aording to its base.
Let us explain the denitions :
F The notion of hronile exatly orresponds to a branh in the forest assoiated with a
dessin, like in examples 7, p. 11, 8, p. 11, 9, p. 11. The onditions eliminate sequenes
that would not ome from an atual dessin.
F Comparability (in the denition of oherene relation) says that whenever   ;   
0
belong to the same design, with  positive, then  = 
0
(typially a negative ation is
followed by a unique positive ation). In partiular a positive design (whih is non-empty
by totality) has a well-dened rst ation, i.e., is a tree.
F Propagation is the most subtle property : ome bak to our examples, for instane 7,
p. 11 : after the rst ation (; f3; 7g), a ternary branhing ours, with a hoie between
three negative ations, (  3; f0g),
(  3; f0; 5g), (  7; ;), say 
i
for i = 1; 2; 3. 
1
and 
2
, whih have the same negative
fous, ome from the same negative rule, 
3
omes from a distint negative rule. 
1
and 
3
have distint foi beause they are performed above two dierent premises of a
positive rule, on whih the ontext splits : oming bak to the original dessin 4, p. 10, we
see that an ation on  has been performed at the extreme left i.e., above 
1
; should we
allow an ation on  above 
3
, we would be unable to split the ontext between 3 and 7.
F The ondition of positivity an be understood as follows : take a hronile  ending with
a negative ation, then it orresponds to one of the premises of a negative rule, and the
onlusion of a positive rule, whih orresponds to the A next B ation. The argument
does not work when  ends with a positive ation, whih may be a daimon, or the premise
of a negative rule of the form (; ;).
F Totality states the existene of a rst ation in ase the base is positive ; it is therefore
a tehnial variant of positivity, made neessary by the fat that we don't reognise the
empty sequene as a hronile ; see also the disussion in subsetion 1.4, p. 14.
It remains to see how to assoiate a dessin to a dessein. The simplest is to do it in two steps :
F First we reonstrut a fake dessin, fake in the sense that we systematially reopy the
ontexts (in the positive rules, 
i
= , in the negative rules 
I
= .) This oers no
diulty.
F Then we remove in the pithfork  `  all the loi that are not used as foi A above B the
pithfork. Observe that we no longer get 
I
= , moreover, the ondition of propagation
implies that, in ase of a positive rule, the 
i
are pairwise disjoint.
Observe that the splitting of the ontext is not deidable, sine it depends on the eventual
behaviour of the design. However we have established the existene of a minimal
9
dessin
assoiated to a design. It is impossible to identify a dessein with its minimal dessin : the
assignment does not ommute to normalisation, to inarnation. . . hene we an hardly all
this assignment anonial.
9
In the sense of the most parsimonious assignment of ontexts.
Jean-Yves Girard 14
1.4. Partial designs
If
10
we drop the totality ondition, i.e., aept the empty set as a design of a given positive
base, then we an speak of a partial design, usual designs being therefore styled total . The
unique quite partial design is denoted by the symbol Fid and is alled the pseudo-design ;
its nikname is Faith
11
, and plays the role of the familiar unsolvable  of -alulus. It
orresponds to the idea of a positive pithfork (the onlusion) with no rule above, what we
an write :


` 
(11)
A natural generalisation would be to allow more partial elements, simply by removing the
ondition of positivity, i.e., an arbitrary positive pithfork not only the onlusion ould
be the onlusion of no rule at all. But this generalisation is fake, for if not a onlusion,
suh a pithfork is the premise of index I of some negative rule (;N ), and the same eet
would be ahieved by severing the premise, i.e., by replaing N with N   fIg.
We an also use the generalisation the other way around : let us formally introdue another
improper positive rule, 
, so that Fid is the positive partial design ending with the A rule B

 . We an now deide that all negative branhings are full (i.e., with diretory N =}
f
(N)) :
we need to omplete the branhings, but any missing branh an be justied by the new rule.
In this presentation, the status of the negative rules is simplied (it beomes quite invertible,
sine what is above  `  is always the rule (; }
f
(N))). The totality ondition just means
that 
 annot be the last rule of a design. This variant whih basially ompliates the
desription of designs-dessins, has no pratial interest ; but it is theoretially important,
sine it suggests a ertain symmetry between the two A improper B rules. Indeed the ordering
of designs, see setion 3.1.2, p. 25, an be synthesised by the formula (20) :

  (; I)  z
However, there is an essential dierene : as we shall see, 
 naturally ours as an innite
loop in normalisation, whereas z orresponds to immediate termination. Imagine that we
want to nd the rst rule of a positive design through normalisation (see below), and let
us admit that we are only interested in a proper rule. The answers 
 and z are therefore
A bugs B, but of dierent nature :
Too late : z says that you will not get your proper rule, but at least you know this.
Please wait : 
 ours in ase your answer never omes, but how an you know it ? Not
only you will not get your proper rule, but you may endlessly expet it.
By the way, we see that the proposal of writing 
 as a rule is non-eetive in the data beause
of the undeidability of the halting problem. But this is not dierent from the situation in
-alulus. One an either see 
 as the reiation of the absene of information (this is a
plain set-theoreti interpretation), or we an see it dynamially, i.e., imagine that a design is
A growing B, streamlike : typially normalisation is a proess in whih we try to get positive
rules (; I) or z above some pithfork, and as long as this information is not obtained, we
an simply write 
.
10
In hapter 7 we shall revisit the expression A partial design B, so as to make it relative to a given bihaviour.
Then 
 appears as the unique A design B whih is quite partial, irrespetively of the bihaviour.
11
To onvey its deep operational meaning : as we shall see the partial design is the formal result of a
diverging normalisation, morally innite. If the result never shows up, only remains the faith that we had
at eah moment that we should eventually get something.
LOCUS SOLUM 15
On the other hand nothing like z exists in the logial literature. The deliate point is
that most interpretations onfuse them
12
(standard denotational semantis identies both
designs Fid and Dai with ;) ; sine everything lies in between Fid and Dai, we just stepped
on the major aw of traditional denotational semantis.
2. Normalisation
Designs an be ombined together so as to form ut-nets, for whih a deterministi normali-
sation proedure will be dened below. Similar proedures are essential in any reasonable
13
sequent alulus (inluding variants suh as natural dedution, proof-nets, lambda-aluli,
et.). The deep meaning of normalisation is omposition of morphisms (if we build a ategory
out of proofs), of strategies (if we take a game-theoreti viewpoint).
The normalisation of designs is deterministi but not neessarily onverging, just as in pure
-alulus. There are two ways to present it, whih are of equal interest :
Dessins : This is an analytial, step-by-step desription, easy to grasp if one keeps in mind
that a design is basially a sequent alulus proof.
Desseins : This is a global, syntheti, desription, whih is essential in the proof of the
main theorems of setion 3.1.
2.1. Normalisation of dessins
2.1.1. Motivations Designs have been onstruted by imitation of ut-free proofs. We should
now introdue designs with uts, but wait, what is ut ? Indeed there is no ut-rule (and no
identity axiom, that's symmetry, isn't it ?). A ut is just a oinidene handle/tine between
the bases of two designs.
To understand what is going on, let us start with our example of subsetion 1.2, p. 6: a ut
between `  ;; A and A `  is easily redued when both proofs end with rules for A
into two uts on P and R in ase (` A; fP;Rg) has been used, or two uts on Q and R
in ase (` A; fQ;Rg) has been used. The same thing happens for designs, but for the fat
that P;Q;R are now alled 3; 4; 7. . . Bureaurati transformation ? Not at all, sine in
the former ase, the formula A was foring a symmetry between left and right rules
14
: the
negative rule uses N = ff3; 7g; f4; 7gg whih quite mathes the two positive rules whih
use either f3; 7g or f4; 7g. But now that we are only left with loations, this mathing is
no longer obvious ! In logial terms, when we are utting, the formulas are no longer fored
to be the same (even if they share the same loation, the loation indues no restrition as
to the possible rules). Conretely it may happen that the last rules of the two designs are
(;N ) and (; I), but that I 62 N : in that ase normalisation fails.
There is one more positive rule, namely the daimon ; sine a ! is almighty, the
normalisation sueeds, but the normalised proof ends with. . . the daimon.
12
But some denotational models of programming languages, e.g., (Cartwright et al., 1994) inlude expliit
error values. The relation of daimon to errors ould be something like: not only give up, but also "onfess
your sins".
13
Unfortunately modern Tartues have been lately produing sequent aluli with no ut-elimination, sort
of ars without engine.
14
The disovery of the symmetry introdution/elimination in the framework of natural dedution is the
essential ahievement of Prawitz, see (Prawitz, 1965). . . if you an nd the book.
Jean-Yves Girard 16
As we know, ut-elimination involves many ommutations of rules. They are as usual, reliable
and boring, with two novelties :
F The disipline of polarities destroys all possible onits, i.e., normalisation is stritly
deterministi.
F In the important ase of a losed net, typially a ut between `  and  `, no ommu-
tation is at work.
2.1.2. Cut-nets

of respetive bases 
p
` 
p
suh that :
Disjuntion : The loi ourring in the bases are pairwise disjoint or equal.
Cuts : Every lous ours in at most two bases. In suh a ase, one ourrene is a handle
and the other is a tine. Suh a shared lous is alled a ut.
Conneted/ayli : The graph whose verties are the 
p
` 
p
and whose edges are the
uts is onneted and ayli.
A design is a partiular ase of ut-net, just let n = 0.
Sine ‚ÑÑ(omponents)   ‚ÑÑ(yles) = ‚ÑÑ(verties)   ‚ÑÑ(edges), the onneted-ayli ondition
may be restated as A onneted and n uts B, or A ayli and n uts B. Sine n handles
are onsumed in uts, there is at most one handle whih is not a ut, and we an form a
pithfork with the unut loi, the onlusion or base of the ut-net ; a ut-net whose base is
the empty pithfork is said to be losed . The unique design D
i
whose base is positive or is
negative with as handle the unut handle of R is the main design of the ut-net, its base is
the main pithfork of the ut-net and its last rule is the main rule of the net.
Remark 3. R is paritary when it is made of paritary designs and, moreover, its base is
paritary. For instane two paritary designs of bases  `  and  `  , yield a non-paritary
net of base  `  . By the way observe that suh a non-paritary net annot be made paritary
by means of an ad ho deloation. Sine paritarism is useful as a type-heker, one is advised
to restrit, as muh as possible, to paritary nets.

F Allowing the designs of R to be partial ; onretely this means the possibility of using
Fid, whih is sine positive the main A design B of suh a partial ut-net.
These two possibilities are very important, sine they an be ombined to formulate the
assoiativity of normalisation, one of the major analytial theorems.
2.1.3. Normalisation : losed ase The ut-elimination proedure, alled normalisation, is
a stritly deterministi proedure whih replaes a ut-net R with a design of the same
base, its normal form JRK ; the proess may diverge, i.e., yield no result, or equivalently
the partial design Fid. This (possibly) innite but loally nite proess proeeds from
the onlusion of the net. We dene it using designs-dessins, but this is just to be friendly.
Sine the ase of a losed ut-net is by far the most interesting, we start with this ase. The
general ase follows.
LOCUS SOLUM 17
Denition 9 (Closed normalisation). Let R be a losed ut-net, then the main design
say D is positive, with main rule  and three ases our :
Daimon :  is the daimon z
15
. Then the net normalises into the unique design with an
empty base, the daimon : JRK = Dai. This ase is the only ase of termination for a
losed net.
Immediate failure :  is (; I). Hene  is a ut, and it ours as the handle of another
design E, the adjoint design of the net, whose last rule is neessarily of the form (;N ).
If I 62 N , then normalisation fails.
Conversion : As above, but I 2 N . For i 2 I , let D
i
be the subdesign of D whose
onlusion is the premise of index i (  i ` : : :) of (; I) and let E
0
be the subdesign
of E indued by the premise of index I (`   I; : : :) of the rule (;N ). Dene S by
replaingD;E by theD
i
;E
0
;S is not neessarily onneted, hene letS
0
be the onneted
omponent of E
0
in S. Then JRK = JS
0
K.
In onversion, the replaement ofS withS
0
is due to the fat that our rules may involve some
A weakenings B : some loi ourring in the onlusions of the main and adjoint designs of
the net may disappear. When S is not onneted, we keep in fat the onneted omponent
of E
0
: as usual weakening indues erasings. This (small) problem disappears with desseins.
The normal form, when it exists, is neessarily the daimon Dai. But the normalisation may
diverge, either by immediate failure, or beause of an innite series of onversions. We use
the notation JRK = Fid to denote the result of a diverging normalisation : this onvention
beomes very useful if we extend normalisation to partial ut-nets. This indues another
ase
Faith : If the main design D is Fid, then the normal form is JRK = Fid.
Although this is a onvenient onvention, we should never forget that there is no eetive
way to determine whether or not a normal form is total, remember that Fid behaves like the

 of -alulus and the symbol u of reursion theory
16
.
2.1.4. Normalisation : open ase Let us now onsider the general ase, where the base is not
supposed to be losed. There are now, besides the three extant ases, two new possibilities :
Positive ommutation : The net is positive, with main rule (; I), but  is not a ut. Let
D
i
be as in the ase of onversion above, and dene R
0
by replaing D with the D
i
. R
0
splits into several onneted omponents, and eah D
i
lies in a omponent R
i
, whih is
a net, and the R
i
are pairwise distint. Let the E
i
be the respetive normal forms of the
R
i
(these normal forms do exist, sine the R
i
are negative, see below). The normal form
of R is the design whose last rule is (; I) and whih proeeds with E
i
above the premise
of index i, i.e.,
JRK =
: : : JR
i
K : : :
(;I)
` ; 
(12)
Negative ommutation : The net is negative, with main rule (;N ) for its main design
D. For I 2 N , let D
I
be the subdesign of D above the premise of index I of the last
rule, and let us replae D with D
I
in R ; and let R
I
be the onneted omponent of D
I
15
If n = 0, then the base is empty and the net is already a daimon.
16
In reursion theory, the symbol u stands for A undened B, and equation f(a) ' b means that if one side
is dened, then the other side is dened and equal.
Jean-Yves Girard 18
(again we don't diretly get a net, beause of weakening). Let N
0
be the subset of N
made of those I for whih R
I
has a normal form E
I
. The normal form of R is dened as
the net ending with (;N
0
) and whih proeeds with E
I
above the premise of index I ,
i.e.,
JRK =
: : : JR
I
K : : :
(;N
0
)
 ` 
(13)
In other terms, the positive ommutation reopies the last rule and then proeeds separately
above eah premise. The negative ommutation, does the same, but some premises may
disappear. Observe that, sine negative ommutation is the only possibility for a negative
ut-net, all negative nets have a normal form : the worse that may happen is that N
0
= ;.
The fat that N is replaed with N
0
in the negative ommutation should be understood
dynamially : N
0
is growing (as soon as we get the last rule of D
I
, we know that I 2 N
0
).
But after all, did we know N that well ? One may very well imagine (espeially if we think
of assoiativity of normalisation, see below) that N is built through a normalisation proess,
and so is growing. The missing premises of a negative rule are just those premises that get
stalled forever. If we stik to this intuition, we must admit that what we alled nite failure
is denitely not nite : we are waiting for a premise of index I , but it will arrive tomorrow,
or the day after et. This is to say that the symbol 
 is really for innite loops.
By the way we an dene normalisation of partial nets, exatly as above. With the onvention
of full negative branhings, the negative ase beomes slightly simpler, sine E
I
is dened
for all I 2 }
f
(N), but of ourse many of the E
I
may be equal to Fid ; the ase A immediate
failure B is replaed with A faith B.
Let us experiment with normalisation. First let us dene an interesting guy :
Denition 10. The negative daimon Dai
 
of base  `  is the design
: : :
z
`   I; : : :
(;}
f
(N))
 ` 
(14)
The usual daimon is sometimes alled the positive daimon, and noted Dai
+
.
Example 10. Any ut between a positive daimon and a design normalises into a positive
daimon : this is obvious from the denitions. Every ut between a negative daimon of base
 `  and a design D of base  `  normalises :
F If  =  and  2 , then the normal form is a negative daimon.
F If  2  and  = ;, then the normal form is a positive daimon in ase D is a daimon or
D ends with a rule fousing on . If D ends with (; I) with  6= , then the normal form
is a design ending with (; I) with negative daimons above eah premise of the rule :
: : :
: : :
z
`   i  I;;   : : :
(i;}
f
(N))
  i ` ;   : : :
(;I)
` ;  
(15)
F If  2  and  = , let (;N ) be the last rule of D ; then the normal form is a restrited
LOCUS SOLUM 19
negative daimon
: : :
z
`   I;;   : : :
(;N )
 ` ;  
(16)
In other terms, a daimon is able to ope with all situations !
Example 11. Consider now the fax Fax of base  ` 
0
, and observe that
F A ut with D of base `  ending with rule (; I) will normalise into a design of base ` 
0
ending with rule (
0
; I).
F A ut with E of base 
0
` ending with rule (
0
;N ) will normalise into a design of base
 ` ending with rule (;N ).
From this it easy to show that, in the rst ase, the normal form is in fat the deloation
(D) of D, i.e., the design obtained by systematially replaing  with 
0
. In the seond ase,
the normal form is the deloation 
 1
(E) of E. More generally, a ut with the fax on  is
normalised by replaing  with 
0
, and a ut with the fax on 
0
is normalised by replaing 
0
with . In partiular the ut between Fax
;
0
and Fax

0
;
00
normalises into Fax
;
00
17
. General
deloations and the assoiated faxes are introdued in example 18, p. 35. To summarise, let
us write the equations :
JFax;DK = (D) (17)
JFax;EK = 
 1
(E) (18)
JFax;D;EK = JD; 
 1
(E)K = J(D);EK (19)
It may be of interest to see what happens with the pseudo-fax of example 3, p. 9. It basially
normalises like the fax, but only keeps ations (; I) (or (
0
; I)) with I 2 ff3; 7g; f4; 7gg.
Conretely this means that a ut with a negative design whose last rule is (
0
;N ) normalises
as a design with last rule (;N \ff3; 7g; f4; 7gg) and that a ut with a positive design whose
last rule is (; I) normalises (i.e., onverges) exatly when I 2 ff3; 7g; f4; 7gg, in whih ase
the normal form is the deloation of D.
2.1.5. Disussion Normalisation is not that obvious to grasp, I hope that the following
omments may help.
1 Normalisation roughly imitates usual syntatial normalisation inMALL, i.e., multipliative-
additive linear logi, modulo foalisation : it just forgets everything about the formulas,
remembering only the loi. This rst approximation is not suient, sine :
F The right analogy would rather be an ane version of MALL, in whih weakening
is allowed on positive sequents.
F There is a new rule, the daimon, whih is a sort of arbitrary axiom ; but a ut with
suh an axiom an only be normalised by means of another axiom.
F It is in general impossible to get onsistent A deorations B of a ut-net, e.g., when
the designs D;E of bases `  and  `  A ome from B proofs of ` A and B ` C with
A 6= B. Typially think of A = A
0
A
00
, B = A
0
B
0
; if A
00
were equal to B
00
, then
we would know what to do. . . beause the syntatial onstraints fore a mathing
between the possible last rules (ramiations) of both proofs, see the disussion p. 15 :
17
If both  ` 
0
and 
0
` 
00
are paritary, then  ` 
00
is not paritary.
Jean-Yves Girard 20
in ase the ramiations do not math, i.e., when I 62 N , the proess of normalisation
diverges.
2 The losed ase is the most important one : the losure priniple will anyway enable
us to redue normalisation to this ase. When I normalise a losed net fD;Eg, the
normalisation appears as :
F A sequene of onversions, orresponding to ations performed in D;E. In fat eah
step orresponds to a pair ; e of opposite ations, one in D, one in E. Of these
two ations, the positive one is obviously ative, sine it disriminates among the
possibilities oered on the other side. It is to be noted that eah step of normalisation
swaps the leader, if the ative role (main rule) has been played by D at stage n, then
E will be ative at stage n+ 1.
F The normalisation an only end with a daimon, whih is the only possible output ;
in partiular, ontrarily to a superial impression, a onversion involving an empty
ramiation is not a terminating step.
F Said an old mahist proverb : man proposes, woman disposes. In partiular, the ative
side may propose a positive ation  whose opposite is not present in the passive side,
this is immediate failure. . .
F Not to be onfused with innite failure, whih orresponds to an endless dialogue
between the partners. General onsiderations about normalisation, esp. assoiativity,
fore us to oneptually identify the two forms of failure, sine D;E may in turn
be given dynamially, i.e., as the result of normalisation, and the missing e may be
nothing but the result of a loal divergene.
3 In the general (open) ase, one may need the ommutations. This is beause the base of
the normal form onsists in the unut loi, and we have to provide the adequate rules.
F These rules are provided anyway by D;E, more preisely they are to be found in
those rules whose fous is not a sublous of a ut.
F Think that we are not trying to onstrut the full normal form JRK, but only a nite
branh an arbitrary one (i.e., a hronile) of the normal form. If the base is
positive, then we must nd a rst rule, daimon (termination) or a proper positive
rule. In suh a ase, we must proeed with the premises JR
i
K, but sine we are only
interested in one branh, we shall only look at one of these premises.
F The proess of building a hronile is alled a dispute, see denition 15, p. 23 ; a
dispute is a trip through the net whih never visits twie the same lous.
2.2. Normalisation of desseins
2.2.1. Cut-nets Let us disuss normalisation as it should be dened, i.e., in terms of desseins,
not dessins. The problem is that there is no hint as to the splitting of ontexts, and this
auses a mess with onversion. For that reason we give a denition of ut-nets adapted to
desseins.
Denition 11 (Cut-nets with desseins). A ut-net is a non-empty nite set
R = fD
0
; : : : ;D
n
g of designs of respetive bases 
p
` 
p
suh that :
Disjuntion : The loi ourring in the bases are pairwise disjoint or equal.
Cuts : A lous annot appear in two handles ; a ut is a lous whih ours one as a
handle and at least one as a tine.
LOCUS SOLUM 21
Conneted/ayli : For eah ut  draw an edge between the pithfork with handle 
and one of the pithforks with tine  (this is alled a swithing). For eah swithing the
graph obtained must be onneted and ayli.
Propagation : If  is a tine in both 
p
` 
p
and 
q
` 
q
, and if ations of fous  are
performed in both of D
p
;D
q
, then p = q.
Example 12. A typial example would be a net fD;D
0
;D
00
g made of designs of respetive
bases  ` , 
0
` , ` ; 
0
. Propagation tells us that fous  annot be used in both of
D;D
0
.
The subtlety of the denition is that  is eventually ative in at most one of the D
p
(by
propagation, a ondition stritly analogous to the ondition of denition 6, p. 12), but we
don't know whih one ; hene we require the onneted/ayli ondition for all possibilities
that may our later, i.e., all swithings. The basi ase of onversion is handled in a simple
way : eah design D
i
reeives the full ontext, hene a lous of the ontext is now present
in several pithforks, but as a tine.
Remark 4. The most onvenient representation of ut-nets as desseins is to see them as sets
of hroniles, i.e., R = D
0
[ : : : [D
n
. But, due to the fat that some loi are both handles
and tines, a fous may be used both positively and negatively : we must be pedanti and
arefully distinguish between  = (; ; I) and its opposite e = ( ; ; I).
2.2.2. Slies and mauls We now give a preise denition of normalisation in terms of des-
seins.
Denition 12 (Slies). A slie is a design (more generally a ut-net) S in whih all
negative rules are at most unary : if   ( 1; ; I);   ( 1; ; I
0
) 2 S, then I = I
0
. A slie of
a design D (more generally of a ut-net R) is any slie S  D (S  R).
In a slie, every proper ation ours at most one ; hene we an dene an arboresent
18
order between the proper ations of a slie :
 <
S

0
i S ontains a hronile     
0
 
0
.
We shall identify S with its proper ations, equipped with the order <
S
: the order enables
one to reover the proper hroniles ; the improper hroniles an be reovered from the
requirement of totality, typially if  is maximal and negative, then a daimon is performed
just after . In what follows, we use the expression A  is a hidden ation B (w.r.t. a given
slie S) to mean that  is proper and its fous  is a sublous of a ut.
Denition 13 (Balane). A nite slie S is balaned when the following holds :
If  is hidden, then
 2 S ) e 2 S
Denition 14 (Mauls). The maul of a balaned slie S is obtained by identifying any
ation with its opposite, notation (1; ; I) (we speak of a neutral ation). This indues a
quotient of the order <
S
, that we note 
S
.
Proposition 1. If S is balaned, then its maul 
S
is a forest.
18
Remember that a forest is an order in whih every initial segment is a nite total order.
Jean-Yves Girard 22
Proof. w.l.o.g. we an assume that the nite slie S does not use the daimon : for instane,
if a daimon is performed just above ` , hoose a fresh lous 
19
and add  to the right
of the appropriated pithforks, so as to replae `  with ` ;  ; instead of performing a
daimon, perform a (; ;). If the property holds for this modied slie S, it surely holds for
S.
Let T be a maximal balaned subforest of S suh that 
T
is an arboresent order. Let 
be minimal in S  T w.r.t. <
S
:
1 If  is positive and visible, i.e., not hidden, then U = T [ fg is still an order, moreover

g is a linear order.
2 If  is negative and visible, then U = T [ fg is still a forest.
3 Assume that none of the previous ases apply : then all possible  are hidden. The idea
is still to add , but, sine we must identify  with e, it would be wiser to look for a 
(not neessarily our initial hoie) suh that ; e are minimal in S  T w.r.t. <
S
. . . and
after see what happens.
(a) If  is positive and 
0
(positive) stands just below e w.r.t. <
S
, then 
0
is hidden and
e

0
<
S
. From this we onlude that e is minimal too.
(b) If  is negative, then onsider the smallest ation 


S
e whih is not in T :
i If 
1

1
is positive, then we are done : hoose 
1
.
ii Otherwise, iterate the proess with the negative 
1
, up to the moment we nd the
appropriate 
n
. We must however show that the proess eventually ends (no loop).
First observe that the 
i
annot endlessly be minimal in S, for if 
i
is minimal,
then the handle of the base of 
i
is a tine of the base of 
i+1
, and a loop would
ontradit ayliity : some 
i
must eventually be non-minimal, and it is an easy
remark that the 
j
(j > i) are non-minimal either. Assume that the onstrution
runs forever, i.e. that all 
j
are negative, and (for j > i) let 

j

and the sequene 

One the adequate  has been found, let U = T [ f; eg, and assume w.l.o.g. that 

2.2.3. Pull-baks
Theorem 1 (Pull-baks).
1 If S is balaned, then JSK onsists of the visible ations of S, with the order indued by

S
.
19
In the ase of a losed net, it might be neessary to deloate rst.
LOCUS SOLUM 23
2 Conversely, if R is a net and S is a nite slie of JRK, there exists a unique balaned
slie T  R, the pull-bak of S along R, suh that S = JTK.
Proof. We only sketh the proof ; as before, we get rid of daimons by enoding them by
means of ad ho positive ations.
1 Take a maximal branh in the maul
S
, and interpret the previous proof as an indutive
onstrution of the branh. Observe that
(a) Case 1 an only be followed by ase 2 ; the branh must end with a ase 1.
(b)Case 2 an only be followed by ases 1 or 3.
() Case 3 an only be followed by ases 2 or 3.
From this it is easy to onlude that what remains of the branh after removal of the
hidden ations is in fat a hronile
20
. One has therefore onstruted a design with the
same base as S. It should be now the time to hek that this design is atually equal to
JSK. . . but this is almost obvious : if we were normalising S as a dessin, then ases 1,
2 and 3 would respetively orrespond to positive ommutation, negative ommutation
and onversion.
2 First of all, uniity : if T;U are balaned slies of R, then the respetive maximal elements
of 
T
and 
U
are those of JTK and JUK. . . hene the same, sine JTK = JUK = S. Below
suh a maximal element , the sets f ;
T
g and f ;
U
g are linearily ordered,
hene they have a ommon initial segment ; it is easily heked that this segment annot
be strit in either orders, hene f ; 
T
g = f ; 
U
g. From this we onlude
that T = U.
Coming bak to the normalisation of desseins, we just observed that ases 1, 2, 3 or-
respond to positive ommutation, negative ommutation, onversion. Indeed a given
hronile  2 JRK ending with a positive ation omes from a well-dened sequene of
ations (that we shall all a dispute, see below), positive, negative, neutral. These a-
tions altogether obviously form a balaned slie, whih is the pull-bak of . Obviously
the pull-bak of S is the union of the pull-baks of the , when  varies through R.
Corollary 1.1. A positive net onverges i it ontains at least one balaned slie.
Corollary 1.2. A losed net onverges i it ontains a balaned slie ; this slie S is unique,
and is linearly ordered by 
S
.
Proof. In the absene of daimon, the maximal elements of 
S
are visible ; the losed ase
orresponds to only one visible ation (that we replaed for onveniene with some (; ;) in
the proof of proposition 1). A forest with one maximal element is a linear order.
2.2.4. Disputes More generally, the pull-bak of a slie is a linear maul :
Denition 15 (Disputes). A dispute of R is a balaned slie S  R suh that 
S
is a
linear order. Equivalently a dispute is the pull-bak of a hronile of JRK.
20
In ase of a paritary slie, the number of hidden ations removed between two onseutive visible ations
is always even, yet another example of type heking.
Jean-Yves Girard 24
Disputes orrespond to all possible ways travels through R during normalisation. Cases 1
and 2 are basially A going B upwards : in a design seen as trivial net, only these ases our
and disputes are just hroniles. But the most important ase is 3 whih enables one to
jump like Tarzan from branh to branh. . . I advise you to try on examples, for instane on
a losed net fFax;D;Eg ; we know that (19)
JFax;D;E)K = JD; 
 1
(E)K = J(D);EK
whih basially means that up to deloation, the fax establishes an interation between
D and E. . . and look at the struture of the fax, p. 9 : there is a systemati under-fousing ,
i.e., the fous of a positive ation is not hosen among the foi just reated, but among foi
reated several here two steps earlier. Without under-fousing, one would always stay
in the same branh. See also remark 6, p. 27.
Slightly antiipating on the denition 17, p. 25, of orthogonality, let us suggest a bridge
towards denotational semantis :
Denition 16. Assume that D?E ; then the pull-bak of hzi along fD;Eg (denoted
[D
 E‚ÑÑ) is the dispute generated by D;E. A dispute orresponds to the sequene
h
0
; : : : ; 
n 1
;zi onsisting of the n 1 onversions performed, followed by the nal daimon.
One of the basi intuition about ludis is to identify a design D 2 G with the set
Dsp
G
(D) = f[D
 E‚ÑÑ ;E 2 G
?
g ; designs appear as sets of disputes, and sine disputes
an be seen as the points of a sort of oherent spae, this bridges ludis with denotational
semantis, see exerise 5, p. 32. However this theory will not be developed in this book.
Remark 5. We extend denition 16 to the ase where D;E are not orthogonal : the partial
dispute [D
 E‚ÑÑ is the unique sequene of onversions performed during the (attempted)
normalisation of the losed net fD;Eg. This sequene is nite or innite.
3. Behaviours
The idea of a behaviour onveys the familiar intuitions of a type, of a logial formula, et.
in usual syntax and of a Sott domain, a oherent spae, et. in denotational semantis.
Sine designs onvey the idea of term, proof, funtion, lique, et. behaviours will be sets of
designs, D 2 G being something of the sort A t is a term of type  B or A  is a proof of A B,
or even A M is a model of A B.
3.1. The main analytial theorems
These theorems are the very essene of ludis : they are analytial, sine they are about
designs, the laymen of behaviours
21
.
Separation : The ludi analogue of the famous theorem, (B√∂hm, 1968; Barendregt, 1984) ;
by the way designs look like B√∂hm trees. . .
Assoiativity : The ludi analogue of the Churh-Rosser property of -alulus, (Churh
and Rosser, 1936; Barendregt, 1984).
Monotoniity : Takes into aount the input of old-style denotational semantis, typially
Sott domains, (Sott, 1976; Amadio and Curien, 1998).
21
Designs have in turn their own laymen, disputes !
LOCUS SOLUM 25
Stability : Takes into aount the input of denotational semantis of the seond generation,
typially oherent spaes, (Girard, 1995b; Amadio and Curien, 1998).
Note that all these properties hold for a single objet, the design, instead of being split
between syntax and semantis. The main notion is orthogonality, whih enables one to for-
mulate these priniples symmetrially : w.r.t. -alulus, ludis introdues the idea of a
symmetry between a term and its environment. The symmetrial nature of ludis is sum-
marised by the losure priniple, whih is nothing but a ombination of separation and
assoiativity.
3.1.1. Orthogonality The rst fundamental notion is orthogonality : two designs of opposite
bases are orthogonal when they form a onverging net.
In what follows we x a base  ` .
Denition 17 (Orthogonality). Let D be a design of base  ` , and let E

be designs of
respetive bases `  (if  2 ) and  ` (if  2 ). We use the notation  D j (E

) for
the normal form JD; : : : ;E

; : : :K (Dai or Fid in ase of divergene) of the net fD; : : : ;E

; : : :g
(a sort of A bilinear form B ). D and the family (E

) are orthogonal when the normal form
is total, i.e., when  D j (E

) = Dai, notation D?(E

).
The base  `  will be known as the pro-base, whereas the bases  ` or `  will be alled
anti-bases or ounter-bases . A design based on the pro-base will be a pro-design, a design
based on one of the anti-bases will be an anti-design or ounter-design.
By far the most important ase is that of an atomi base : then there is exatly one E

and we use the simplied notations  D j E and D?E . In that ase there is only one
anti-base and the two bases play symmetri roles. We shall espeially in proofs, where the
general ase is hardly more than a notational noise try to restrit to the atomi ase.
Nobody forbids us to extend the relation of orthogonality to partial designs : the pseudo-
design is orthogonal to nobody !
3.1.2. Separation
Denition 18 (Preedene). The set of designs of base  `  is equipped with the
topology generated by the sets (E

)
?
. The preorder (preedene) relation is dened by
D
?
 D
0?
.
Sine the losure of a point D is the biorthogonal D
??
, the preorder an be dened by
D  D
0
$ D
0
2 D
??
. The topology will be T
0
(the weakest form of separation) exatly
when  is a partial order, what we now prove, by providing an expliit haraterisation of
the order. We rst need to introdue some spei designs :
Denition 19. If  is a proper hronile over an atomi pro-base, we dene the anti-design
Opp

as follows :
F If  ends with a negative ation, then Opp

onsists exatly of the (opposites of the)
ations performed in .
F If  ends with a positive ation, then Opp

onsists of the (opposites of the) ations
performed in , together with an appropriate daimon.
(Indeed the denition would make sense for an arbitrary base : Opp

beomes a family of
designs ; the denition just given yields the union of the family.)
Jean-Yves Girard 26
Does this make sense ? A (anti)-design is a set of hroniles, not a set of ations. . . and there
may be several designs with exatly the same ations, e.g., one made from h
0
; 
1
; 
2
; 
3
;zi
and its sub-hroniles, one made from h
2
; 
1
; 
0
; 
3
;zi. But, sine these ations ome from
a single hronile , we an observe :
F That the negative rules of Opp

are at most unary : for in  eah fous is used exatly
one : Opp

is a nite slie.
F That there is no ambiguity as to the order in whih positive ations are performed : eah
time a hronile of Opp

must hoose a positive ation, there is only one hoie available.
To sum up, the anti-design is unique. . .
F Provided it exists ! There is no problem with oherene whih deals with dierent positive
anti-ations with the same fous. But we ould meet problems with positivity. Indeed if
the last ation of  is positive, then we don't get a design : we must add a daimon to
ensure positivity.
Theorem 2 (Separation).  is a partial order, i.e., the topology is T
0
. In fat D  D
0
i D is more dened than D

, i.e., if every hronile  2 D D

Proof. We assume that the base is atomi, and we use the temporary notation D  D

for
D is more dened than D

F Assume that D  D

is obtained by restriting the
negative rules of D

, rules (;N ) being replaed with rules (;N
0
) with N  N

.
If D
00
?E, then the fat of adding more premises in the negative rules annot ruin
onvergene, and we onlude that D
0
?E.
I In terms of designs, D
00
is obtained by replaing ertain subdesigns of D by daimons :
this amounts to replaing positive rules with daimons. If D?E, and the normalisation
proeeds so as to have suh a modied rule as main rule, then the replaement of the
rule by a daimon ensures a quiker onvergene, so D
00
?E.
F Assume that D 6 D

. This means that some hronile  2 D D
0
is suh that for all
deompositions  =

z 62 D

The normalisations of  D j E and  D

22
Curien views this as an instane of a general deomposition of the extensional ordering (D 6 D

of onversions, orresponding to the ations of 
0
, up to the moment we arrive at a ut-
net with main ation (; I) (or 
0
). Then  D j E onverges whereas  D
0
j E
diverges :
1a After a onversion between the ation ( 1; ; I) and the anti-ation (+1; ; I), the
daimon of D makes  D j E onverge.  D
0
j E diverges beause there is no
anti-ation in E that mathes the ations ( 1; ; J) of D
0
whih follow 
0
.
1b The same argument shows that  D
0
j E diverges in this ase too.  D j E
onverges beause of the daimon following e in E.
2 After a onversion between the ation (+1; ; I) and the anti-ation ( 1; ; I), the
daimon of E makes  D j E onverge.  D
0
j E diverges beause there is no
anti-ation in E that mathes the ation 
0
of D

F It would remain to hek that the relation D  D

obvious (see also the disussion below).
Remark 6. It is perhaps interesting to pay a visit to Tarzan.  is linear (a single hronile),

, whereas Opp

an only explore

under-fousing in .
D  D
0
means that the design D is more dened than the design D
023
when D
0
is obtained
from D by means of an enlargement of the negative rules and a replaement of some positive
rules by daimons. But why do we say that D is more dened ? This is lear onerning the
daimons, a daimon is more opportunisti (i.e., less informative) than a proper ation. As to
negative rules, we have to think that D takes more hanes, he knows more what he wants
or does not want. Typially the negative daimon who has a full branhing does not arry
any information : if you say A yes B to everybody, who are you ?
However the idea of wider negative rules and shorter branhes does not quite work with
dessins. In the rst half of the previous proof, we were able to produe ommon dessins for
D;D
00
and D
00
;D
0
, but this is generally not possible between D;D
0
. So this is a onvenient
intuition, and nothing more. One an summarise this priniple by the inequality :

  (; I)  z (20)
whih means that we an replae 
 (absent premise of negative rule) with a real premise,
and that a proper positive ation an be replaed with a daimon. By the way what are
the maximal, minimal elements of  ? The daimons are learly maximal w.r.t.  : simply
beause they are absolutely opportunisti, i.e., they are orthogonal to anybody.
Example 13. When the base is negative, there is a smallest element, namely the empty
design Sk = ;, the Skunk :

(21)
23
Sorry for the mismath, but there is a onit between A more dened B and A more easily normalised B.
After hesitations, I deided to order  this way on the grounds that it orresponds to the tradition, and
that inlusion (see subsetion 3.1.3, p. 28), is a partiular ase of .

of disagreement between any two of these disputes, and observe that the ondition of

4 On oherent spaes, the stable ordering orresponds to inlusion : the stability property
of Berry (Berry, 1978) formulated in oherent spaes (Girard, 1995b), states that
f(a \ b) = f(a) \ f(b) provided a [ b is a lique.
The stability of designs yields

3.1.4. Assoiativity Stritly speaking, sine normalisation is deterministi, there is no need
for a Churh-Rosser property. But besides the tehnial meaning of Churh-Rosser, there is a
deeper one, namely that in the presene of two uts, the output of normalisation is the same,
whether we normalise them together, or one after the other, something like ABC = (AB)C :
Theorem 4 (Assoiativity). Normalisation is assoiative : let fR

Furthermore (and this is by far the most important point) the result holds without hypothe-
ses of totality.

The other diretion is established in a similar way.
In other terms, given S = fR

Tehnially speaking, the theorem is hardly more than the Churh-Rosser property for
multipliative-additive logi formulated in terms of proof-nets (Girard, 1996), with some
minor modiations.
3.1.5. The losure priniple The priniple basially states that we an restrit to losed nets.
Typially, if D;E are designs of respetive bases  `  and ` , the normal form JD;EK is
the unique design D
0
of base `  suh that for every F of base  ` :
JD
0
;FK = JD;E;FK (29)
The normal form of a net S is determined by the normal forms of all ompletions of S
into a losed net. The priniple is very useful, sine losed nets do not need ommutative
onversions.
Theorem 5 (Closure priniple). Let R be a net of base  ` . Then the normal form
JRK of R is the unique design D suh that for any family of anti-designs (E

) D?(E

) i
the losed net JR [ : : : [ E

[ : : :K = Dai, i.e., onverges.
Jean-Yves Girard 30
Proof. That R satises the ondition follows from assoiativity, and uniity is guaranteed
by separation.
The losure priniple stands behind the assoiativity of multipliatives, see hapter 5, for it
basially asserts the possibility of dening adjoints by equations of the style (67), see p.46 ;
suh an equation is reminisent of the familiar Hilbert spae denition :
hu(x) j yi = hx j u

Observe that suh a thing may sometimes happen ludis is better behaved than Hilbert
spaes on this sole question, for if u is an operator, we annot dene u by means of something
like hu(x) j yi = hu j x

As for the other analytial theorems, the theorem persists for partial nets.

traditional extensional
27
order, whih is dened in the style
f  g i f(a)  g(a) for all a.
In ludis the role of the extensional order is played by, whereas the stable order orresponds

3.2. Behaviours and inarnation
3.2.1. Behaviours
Denition 20. A behaviour is a set G of designs of a given base equal to its biorthogonal.
A behaviour is positive or negative aording to the polarity of its base.
A Set B is to be taken in its straightforward meaning, with no lurking onstrutivist, pred-
iativist, et. restrition.
Example 15.
1 The set of all designs of a given base is a behaviour, the Skunk, equal to ;
?
. We use the
notation >

where  is the polarity of the base or simply > when the base is negative.
2 The set fDai

g, is a behaviour, the Daimon, indeed the smallest one, equal to ;
??
. We
use the notation 0

or simply 0 when the base is positive.
3 More generally, if E is any set of anti-designs, then E
?
is a behaviour, and any behaviour
is of this form (take E =G
?
).
Example 16. There is a smallest behaviour (think of the A prinipal type B) ontaining a
given design D, namely D
??
. This prinipal behaviour is given by the formula
D
??
= fD
0
;D  D
0
g (34)
Sine the daimons are orthogonal to all designs, every behaviour ontains the daimon of the
right polarity. The nightmare of empty types is denitely xed. Behaviours enjoy ertain
immediate losure properties.
Theorem 7 (Closure). If D  E and D 2 G then E 2 G.
If K is non-empty and D

Proof. Immediate from the denition 18 of , p. 25, and the stability theorem 3, p. 28.
3.2.2. Inarnation If D 2 G and D  E, then E 2 G, but for A bad B reasons : none of
the new hroniles in E is useful to guarantee the membership to G. So to speak D;E are
A equivalent B in G and G is naturally equipped with an equivalene relation, whih is
the symmetri and transitive losure of inlusion. But fortunately, one an distinguish one
design jDj

Theorem 8 (Inarnation). Given E 2 G there is a smallest design D  E suh that
D 2 G.
Proof. The set of designs of G inluded in E is a non-empty family whose union is a design.
By the losure theorem 7, p. 31, the intersetion D of this family does belong to G.
Denition 21 (Inarnation). The design D of theorem 8, p. 31, is alled the inarnation

3.2.3. Behaviours as games Our basi objetion to A game semantis B is that we don't want
any lurking referee. But by no way we refuse games as a useful intuition. Indeed ludis is
about games, but games by onsensus, not games with an external rule. In what follows we
give the game-theoreti translation of a losed net JD;EK.
Players : They are niknamed Even and Odd . One we take the viewpoint of one of these
players, he is alled Proponent (positive), the other player being styled Opponent (neg-
ative) , A I B vs. A You B.
Plays : A play is the sequene of onversions involved in the onverging normalisation
of  D j E , what we alled a dispute, see subsetion 2.2.4, p. 23. One we take
the viewpoint of one player, e.g., the side of D, then the positive ations are moves of
Proponent, and their parity is the parity of D, i.e., of Proponent.
Strategies : Clearly D;E play the roles of strategies for Proponent and Opponent.
Winner : Who wins, who loses, is to be dened in setion 8.1. For the moment, let us
mention only one of the winning onditions : not to play the daimon, i.e., not to give up.
This desription is not satisfatory, sine in a usual game, the idea is more or less to win :
assume that D has a positive base ` , then the design
One =
(;;)
` 
(39)
is perfetly winning, sine Opponent an only reat by a daimon, i.e., by giving up : the only
hronile extending h( 1; ; ;)i is h( 1; ; ;);zi ! In other terms, Proponent an use the
atomi weapon, not quite an exiting interative idea ! But this is beause we are dealing
with unrestrited designs.
Rule : In a behaviour, Proponent and Opponent behave aording to two sets G;G
?
of
designs. The orthogonality ondition an be seen as a onstraint, i.e., that designs in G
must be orthogonal to G
?
: G
?
is A the rule of the game G B, and onversely G is A the
LOCUS SOLUM 33
rule of the game G
?
B. Only a few games an be desribed in this interative way : we
are therefore limiting our A language B to use an expression of another entury but
what an be expressed in this restrited fashion has exeptional properties.
The remainder of the book will demonstrate the power of the method, so let us just give
an example, i.e., how we an interatively help Proponent from using the atomi weapon
(; ;) : it is enough to put in G
?

(40)
sine  One j E  = Fid, i.e., One 6?E : so to speak, the design E A reuses B the ation
(; ;), there is a dissensus .
The design (40) is not quite a strategy, in the sense that Opponent has not the slightest
hane to win
28
. If we onsider that the output of a non-onverging net is a draw, Opponent
is playing for a draw .
Inside a behaviour G a design D plays the role of a strategy, but two designs with the same
inarnation indue the same plays, i.e., the same strategy. This is why we an think of the
inarnation jDj
G
as the strategy indued by D in the A game B G.
3.2.4. Behaviours as syntax or semantis We an more or less imagine that a design is like
a proof, but we ould as well see a design as a sort of model. Then the duality between G
and G
?
an be seen as syntax/semantis, if we deide to put the syntax on the side of G,
the semantis on the side of G
?
. The orthogonality relates a would-be proof of G with a
would-be refutation of the same G. We have abolished in priniple this shizophrenia
syntax/semantis, but there is still a real dierene, namely that syntax is usually given by a
set of rules, whih in turn gives rise to a semantis, and then the question of the ompleteness
of the syntax is posed.
Denition 22 (Completeness). An ethis is a set E of designs of a given base  `  ;
if E
??
=G, one says that E is an ethis for G. An ethis is omplete when it ontains the
inarnation of its biorthogonal, i.e., when jE
??
j  E.
Usually a behaviour G will be presented by an ethis, i.e., G = E
??
. The typial example
of an ethis is the set E of the designs whih orrespond to the syntatial proofs of a given
formula A. The ounter-models of A an be replaed with E
?
, so that E
??
stands for what
is validated by all ounter-models of A, so that ompleteness for A is basially the fat
that the biorthogonal is not needed. Sometimes (espeially in the negative ase) E
??
= E
beomes wrong for stupid reasons : this is why ompleteness is only modulo inarnation. A
typial example is given by the maximum behaviour> whih admits the nite ethis fSkg !
3.3. Connetives
The next three hapters will analyse behaviours, so as to understand how behaviours are
reated from simpler ones, i.e., how they soialise. A onnetive may be ovariant or on-
travariant in eah parameter. Using negation, we an restrit to ovariant onnetives : a
28
Unless Proponent is stupid enough to start with a daimon.
Jean-Yves Girard 34
ovariant onnetive is inreasing w.r.t. inlusion, i.e., ompatible with A subtyping B.
We end this hapter with some elementary examples of onnetives.
3.3.1. Deloation
Denition 23 (Deloation). A deloation from lous  to lous 
0
is a partial injetive
map  from the subloi of  to the subloi of 
0
suh that
F () = 
0
F For all  there is a funtion 

from biases to biases suh that (  i) = ()  

(i).
A deloation is positive when ; 
0
have the same parity, negative otherwise.
If  = h: : : ; (
p
; I
p
); : : :i is a proper hronile of base `  (resp.  `), one denes () of base
` 
0
(resp. 
0
`) as () = h: : : ; ((
p
); 

p
(I
p
)); : : :i. If  is an improper hronile d z, one
denes () = (d) z.
If D is a design of base `  (resp.  `) one denes (D) = f();  2 Dg, a design of base
` 
0
(resp. 
0
`).
Example 17. We dene two deloations ';  from hi to itself :
'(i  ) = 3i   (41)
 (i  ) = (3i+ 1)   (42)
These deloations are of the style Hilbert hotel : A Not enough rooms, you are kidding ! Just
rename room ‚ÑÑn as ‚ÑÑ3n. . . (resp. ‚ÑÑ3n+1) B : two hotels an be aommodated inside a single
one, moreover, there is still room for a third hotel (the rooms ‚ÑÑ3n+ 2). So when we need a
spiritual binary onnetive, we shall use the deloating faility, typially
GH = '(G) ‚ÑÑ  (H), see setion 4.2.2, p. 38. These deloations are almost disjoint : this
means that the ranges =(') and =( ) interset on the sole hi : this peuliarity will be used
to dene spiritual onnetives.
Denition 24 (Deloation : behaviours). If G is a behaviour of base `  (resp.  `)
and  is a total deloation from  to 
0
, dene the behaviour (G) of base ` 
0
(resp. 
0
`)
by :
(G) = f(D);D 2 Gg
??
(43)
Proposition 2. The material designs of (G) are exatly the images under  of the material
designs of G.
Typially, the image under  of the behaviour > is not >, unless  is surjetive. But it
ontains the only material design of (>) =>, i.e., the Skunk.
Corollary 2.1. The image under  of G is a omplete ethis for (G).
Deloation is not exatly a onnetive : this onvenient operation, essential to dene spiritual
operations like the usual onnetives of logi, hardly hanges anything : it is rather a way
of reating A ourrenes B. Deloation is essential to seond-order quantiation, sine we
must speak of dierent ourrenes of the same propositional variable X : as a variable, X
stands for a positive behaviour X of base ` hi, as an ourene, X stands for a deloation
(X).

3.3.2. The shift This seemingly minor operation is one of the true tehnial novelties of
ludis. It basially hanges the polarity, by adding a A dummy ation B.
Denition 25 (Shift). Let  be a hronile of base ` ;   i (resp.   i ` ) ; the shift l
of  is the hronile (; fig)   of base  `  (resp. ` ;).
If D is a design of base ` ;   i (resp.   i ` ), the shift of D is the design
lD = fl;  2 Dg [ fh(; fig)ig of base  `  (resp. ` ;).
If G is a behaviour of base `   i (resp.   i `), the shift of G is the behaviour
lG = flD;D 2 Gg
??
of base  ` (resp. ` ).
A prime behaviour is any behaviour of the form lG.
It is onvenient to replae l with # (resp. " ) when the polarity of the shift is positive
(resp.negative)
30
.
Proposition 3. If G is negative, then #G = f#D;D 2 Gg [ fzg.
If G is positive, then f"D;D 2 Gg is a omplete ethis for "G.
Moreover (lG)
?
=l(G
?
).
This (obvious) proposition establishes the ompleteness of the shift, by providing omplete
ethis. In the ase of a positive shift, the daimon has to be added, i.e., there is the possibility
of giving up ; in partiular the shift is not involutive, even up to isomorphism. In the
negative ase, the set of shifts is only a omplete ethis, sine we an enlarge our designs
with hroniles not beginning with (; fig), without hanging the inarnation.
The shift enables one to dene onnetives in ase of mismath of polarities, typially we
an dene G
H by G
 #H; #G
H; #G
 #H, when at least one of G;H is negative.
29
We should indiate ; , but the notation would be too heavy.
30
To remember the notation : #hanges a negative behaviour into a positive one, like the exponential A ! B.
Jean-Yves Girard 36
4. Additives
In the (informal) hierarhy of onnetives, additives stand below multipliatives, simply
beause impliation by far the most important onnetive, think of syllogisms is basially
multipliative. Indeed these onnetives are more diult to grasp than multipliatives, for
several reasons:
F -alulus is basially multipliative/exponential. Of ourse a useful pairing funtion an
be dened in -alulus, but it is not the real thing.
F The tradition of natural dedution is unsatisfatory too, sine intuitionisti disjuntion
(not too far from the additive disjuntion) is badly behaved. The A ommutative rules B
of disjuntion learly indiate a mismath
31
.
F With linear logi, additives beame primitive onnetives, but they still were mistreated.
For instane multipliative proof-nets avoid in a perfet way ommutative onversions
for the positive 
, but additive proof-nets are not that simple. Geometry of interation
works simply for multipliatives and exponentials (Girard, 1989a), but its extension to
additives (Girard, 1995a) is not that suessful.
In ludis additives are really given their full spae ; indeed ludis basially omes from a
reetion on additives, esp. neutrals, and this is why additives appear as the onnetives
with the best properties, if not the most important ones. They are also easy to understand,
and this is why we start with them.
General loative additives

are introdued,
T

being the general form of an A intersetion
type B. These operations have no exeptional properties, but for the fat of being stritly
ommutative and assoiative. The onnetives &; orrespond to the partiular ase of
disjoint behaviours. The additive deomposition writes any behaviour as a  (positive ase)
or & (negative ase) of onneted behaviours, the deomposition being unique. Complete
ethis are given for  and &, under the form of the two remarkable theorems of the hapter :
Disjuntion property : GH is the union G [H.
Mystery of inarnation : & behaves like the Cartesian produt on inarnations.
In this hapter, the base is atomi, either ` hi or hi `.
4.1. Loative additives
4.1.1. Diretories The designs Ram
(hi;I)
(positive) have already been introdued (exam-
ple 14, p. 28) ; we now introdue the designs Dir
N
(negative) Diretory :
Dir

` I : : :

(47)
Denition 26. A diretory is a set N of ramiations. If G is a positive behaviour, the
diretory of G is the set {G = fI ;Ram
(hi;I)
2 Gg. If G is a negative behaviour, the
inarnation jDai
 
j
G
of the negative daimon is of the form Dir
N
for some diretory N ,
31
Due to the fat that, unlike the negative onnetives );^;8, disjuntion and existene are positive.
Natural dedution, entered on impliation, is negative, i.e., A proeeds downwards B, whereas the positive
operations like disjuntion proeed upwards.
LOCUS SOLUM 37
whih is by denition the diretory of G : jDai
 
j
G
= Dir
{G
.
A reservoir is any set of biases ; the reservoir of a behaviour is dened as xG =
S
{G.
Proposition 4. If G is positive, then {G onsists of those I suh that (hi; I) is the rst
ation of a design D 2 G. Moreover {G
?
= {G.
Proof. If (hi; I) is the rst ation of D 2 G, then D  Ram
(hi;I)

is learly of the form Dir

, and it is
immediate that I 2 N exatly when (hi; I) is the rst ation of some D 2 G.
4.1.2. The onnetive A Inter B
Denition 27 (Inter). Let G
k
be a family of behaviours of the same base. Then we dene
T
k
G
k
as the intersetion of the G
k
.
The denition makes sense beause an intersetion of orthogonals is the orthogonal of a
union. We use the more spei notations
T
-
;
p
to indiate the polarity of the G
k
.
Proposition 5. The onnetive
T
is stritly ommutative and assoiative. Its neutral el-
ement is the empty intersetion, namely the Skunk >

and its absorbing element is the
smallest negative behaviour, the Daimon 0

.
The most important point is A stritly B, we are speaking of equalities, not of vague isomor-
phisms.
4.1.3. The onnetive A Union B Assume that the base is positive.
Denition 28 (Union). Let G
k
be a family of behaviours. Then we dene
S

k
G
k
as
(
S
k
G
k
)
??
.
We use the more spei notations
S
-
;
U
to indiate the polarity of the G
k
.
Proposition 6. The onnetive
S
 is stritly ommutative and assoiative. Its neutral ele-
ment is the Daimon 0

and its absorbing element is the Skunk >

.
Completeness fails for
S
 , sine there is no general way to remove the biorthogonal, i.e., to
nd a omplete ethis ; the disussion in subsetion 6.1.2, p. 54, establishes that one may
think of
S
 as the only inomplete onnetive.

4.2. Additives
4.2.1. Plus and With
Denition 29. Two behavioursG;H of the same polarity are disjoint when their diretories
are disjoint. A behaviour G is onneted when its diretory {G is a singleton fIg, in whih
ase I is alled the ramiation of the behaviour.
We use the notations
L
;& instead of
U
;
T
-
to signify that the operation has been applied
to pairwise disjoint behaviours.
Proposition 8. The positive behaviours G;H are disjoint i G \H = 0 (= fDaig).
The negative behaviours G;H are disjoint i for all D 2 G;E 2 H

4.2.2. The spiritual dilemma The onnetive  is partial, but spiritual logi addited us to
total operations. We are left with a dilemma :
F Either we keep things as they are, so that the onnetive remains partial, but with
exeptionally good properties, in partiular, real equalities, not isomorphisms.
F Or we absolutely want a total operation, orresponding to familiar disjuntion. Then
we x two deloations ';  from hi to itself, see example 17, p. 34, and we redene
GH as '(G) ‚ÑÑ  (H). The deloated onnetive just introdued is total
33
, but no
longer handled by equalities, only (anonial) isomorphisms. The equalities proven below
beome anonial isomorphisms : typially the disjuntion property (theorem 11, p. 40)
beomes GH = '(G) [  (H).
32
See also exerise 3.

As long as ; 62 {G;{H, see below.
LOCUS SOLUM 39
Unless otherwise stated, we make the hoie of the strit, but partial operations : an equality
is nier than an isomorphism ; the same hoie will be made for the other onnetives,
e.g., &;
;P. As far as we deal with spiritual issues, i.e., questions whose solution does
not depend on the loation, e.g., ompleteness issues, this methodologial bias is by far a
big simpliation. However, the most novel loative features, typially the prenex forms of
hapter 6, ruially depend on the fat that onnetives reeive their standard meaning : in
that hapter they will be treated as total operations.
It must be observed that deloation is not always possible, there is a problem with the
tensor unit see subsetion 5.2.4, p. 51 whih uses an empty ramiation that annot
be deloated. If we are onerned with spiritual logi, it is therefore advisable to restrit to
behaviours G suh that ; 62 {G.
4.3. Completeness properties
The purpose of this setion is to provide us with omplete ethis for the onnetives & and
.
4.3.1. The mystery of inarnation We formulate the result in the binary ase, but it holds
without restrition.
Theorem 10 (Mystery of inarnation).
jG&Hj = jGj  jHj (53)
Proof. Assume that D 2 G&H is material ; then the two inarnations E = jDj
G
and
F = jDj
H
are inluded in D. We onlude that E [ F  D.
Conversely, if E;F are respetively inarnated in G;H, then proposition 8, p. 38, shows that
they are disjoint, so their union is a design D. Should D not be inarnated in G&H, we
would get E
0
[ F
0
( D for appropriate E
0
;F
0
and one of E;F would not be inarnated.
To sum up the material designs in G&H are exatly the unions of a material design of G
and a material design of H, and suh a deomposition is unique.
Remark 9. There is in fat something shy about this result, sine the left-hand side
involves a stritly ommutative operation, whereas the Cartesian produt is notoriously non
ommutative et. : we should have rather written an isomorphism. Our symbol of equality
means that among all possible isomorphi denitions of the produt, we hoose the best one,
namely
X
[

Y = fx [ y;x 2 X; y 2 Y g (54)
This loative produt is stritly ommutative, assoiative, with f;g as neutral. But when any
x 2 X is disjoint from any y 2 Y , we use the notation X  Y . This is therefore a partial
operation, whih is to the usual Cartesian produt what our & is to the usual one.
The mystery of inarnation also makes sense for the deloated version of &, see subse-
tion 4.2.2, p. 38, and writes as
jG&Hj ' jGj  jHj (55)
But we only get an isomorphism, and we must be uent in ategory theory to atually
express that this isomorphism is A natural B. There is a better reason, beyond ategorial
Jean-Yves Girard 40
nonsense : an underlying equality !
The loative produt is to the usual set-theoreti produt what union is to disjuntion. If
you look at the extant literature, you will surely nd many examples of this basi operation
whih seems to have been overlooked.
4.3.2. The disjuntion property The dual version of the mystery of inarnation.
Theorem 11 (Disjuntion property). If the index set is non-empty, then
M
k
G
k
=
[
k
G
k
(56)
Proof. The ase of a binary  is enough. If D 2 (G [H)
??
 G [H, then D is not or-
thogonal to some E 2 G
?
and some F 2 H
?
, and we an assume both of E;F material.
But we know by proposition 8, p. 38, that E \ F = ; : E [ F is a design in the intersetion
G
?
\H
?
, not orthogonal to D, a ontradition.
In other terms we have found a omplete ethis for the onnetive A Plus B. In partiular
GH =G [H, with quite the old familiar meaning A A ut-free proof of A  B is proof
of A or a proof of B B, proofs being replaed with designs, and formulas with behaviours.
Observe that the disjuntion is not exlusive, sine G \H = fDaig, but sine the daimon is
losing, see setion 8.1, p. 67, it will be exlusive as long as winning designs are onerned.
4.3.3. Additive deomposition
Theorem 12 (Additive deomposition). Any positive behaviour an be written in a
unique way as the
L
of onneted behaviours
G =
M
I2{G

daimon. Sine G =

Corollary 12.1. Any negative behaviour an be written in a unique way as the & of

Exerise 6. In the negative ase, show that a omplete ethis for G

=> depending on the polarity of G.
4.4. Subtyping
4.4.1. Subtyping and inarnation Let us omment these results, espeially the mystery of
inarnation whih relates the two readings of the additive onjuntion, intersetion and
produt : this has to do with subtyping and inheritane. G&H  H means that every
objet of type G&H is of type H. We are therefore dealing with some kind of reord :
LOCUS SOLUM 41
a omponent for G, a omponent for H, and perhaps additional omponents that do not
matter, typially if our design D belongs to G&H&K. Now what is inarnation ? This
is the part of the design relevant to a behaviour. Hene jDj
G&H
only retains the part of D
relevant to G;H, whereas jDj
H
kills informations relative to G. Sine these informations
are disjoint, we get the result.
This mystery is only possible beause of the oexistene of two notions inside ludis :
F The oial notion of a behaviour, for whih an objet of type G&H is an objet of type
G. In this oneption, subtyping is inlusion.
F The old-style denition, for whih a pair (a; b) 2 A&B is not of type A : we are in fat
dealing with material designs. Subtyping is handled through operations whih destroy
the useless part, i.e., ompute the inarnation in the supertype : oerion maps.
The additive deomposition orresponds to a sort of general A reord style B : eah rami-
ation I denotes a eld maybe missing. For an inarnated design of G&H, there is one
omponent for eah I 2 {G [ {H ; the oerion between G&H and H orresponds to the
removal of those omponents I whih belong to {G. Suh a oerion an be implemented,
provided both behaviours have been deloalised at disjoint loi  ` (for G&H) and 
0
`
(for H) by a partial fax, indued by the partial deloation ( I ) = 
0
I , for I 2 {H,
and whih is undened on I  for I =2 {H. The pseudo-fax of example 3, p. 9, implements
suh a oerion, in the ase {H = ff3; 7g; f4; 7gg.
4.4.2. Inarnation and reords Imagine the following reord
oord : (3; 4) olour : green shape : irle (59)
The elds oord,olour,shape are respetively enoded by means of the biases 2; 3; 8 :
they beome negative behaviours respetively inluded in (Ram

rendered by f2m; 2n+ 1g, so that (3; 4) beomes
34
f6; 9g, olours are enoded by numbers,
for instane green is 8, and the shape irle orresponds to the bias 0. Our reord an be
expressed by means of the negative design :

Jean-Yves Girard 42
But say that we don't are about shapes, only oordinate and olour matter : our design
is anyway of type oord& olour. However, sine the shape is not used, we ould as well
replae it with its inarnation

The next example is a (sort of) fax that takes a reord, and, regardless of the other

These basi remarks are just an invitation to revisit the extant approahes to subtyping in
the light of ludis, e.g., the intersetion types developed in Torino (Coppo et al., 1981). The
onnetion with objet-oriented programming in the style of (Abadi and Cardelli, 1996) is
also very exiting. . .
5. Multipliatives
Let us turn our attention towards multipliatives, the main onnetives of logi : their
importane is due to the prenany of linear impliation  √Ü, whih is the part of intuitionisti
or lassial impliation whih deals with impliation, the other part dealing with reuse, as
Jean-Yves Girard 44
expressed by the founding formula
A) B = !A √ÜB (64)
The basi notion is that of the tensor produt A~B
35
of two positive designs. Indeed
the denition is not that obvious when the ramiations I; J of the rst ations of A;B
interset : there are four protools, two asymmetri, two symmetri, giving rise to the tensor
produts A<B, A=B (=B<A), AB and A:B. Eah of these tensors has an adjoint
appliation, namely F[A‚ÑÑ; [A‚ÑÑF; (F)A; fFgA. As a onsequene, the onnetives dened from
these tensors are assoiative et. ; they are related by the inlusions
 
<
=
 : (65)
Under the hypothesis of mutual independene, all these tensors reeive natural omplete
ethis. The stronger hypothesis of being mutually alien makes the four tensors ollapse into
a single one, noted 
.
As usual, the base is atomi, either ` hi or hi `.
5.1. Loative multipliatives
5.1.1. Non-ommutative adjuntions
Denition 30 (N.C. tensor produt of designs). We dene the tensor produt A<B
of positive designs A;B :
F If one of A;B is a daimon, then A<B = Dai.
F Otherwise A;B have respetive rst ations (hi; I) and (hi; J). Replae in eah hronile
of A;B the rst ation (hi; I) or (hi; J) with (hi; I [ J), so as to get A
0
;B
0
. A<B is the
subset of A
0
[B
0
onsisting of
I All hroniles of B
0
.
I Those hroniles of A
0
whose seond ation (i; I
0
) is suh that i =2 J .
In other terms, when the ramiations I; J overlap, part of A is replaed. Imagine an air
plane : rst laymen book (design A), then omes the time of the VIP (design B) : in ase
of onit for one seat (bias k 2 I \ J) the VIP gets it
36
.
Remark 11. The tensor produt of designs has been dened in the ase of an atomi
base ; but the denition an immediately be extended to the general ase of two positive
bases ` ;, ` ;
0
suh that ` ;;
0
is a pithfork. The same will be true for the two
ommutative tensors. . .
Theorem 13 (N.C. adjuntions). Let F;A;B be designs, F (think of a funtion) negative,
A;B (think of arguments) positive. Then there exist unique negative designs F[A‚ÑÑ (not
depending on B), [B‚ÑÑF (not depending on A) suh that
 F j A<B = F[A‚ÑÑ j B = A j [B‚ÑÑF (66)

We use the notation ~ for one of the many tensor produts that arise naturally.

Fortunately, modern ompanies have heard of ategory theory and spiritual priniples : they use deloation
to minimise suh onits.

Proof. Uniity is a onsequene of the separation theorem 2, p. 26, so let us onentrate on
existene.
First observe that F[Dai‚ÑÑ = [Dai‚ÑÑF = Dai
 
is enough to satisfy the equations if one of A;B
is a daimon. So we are left with the onstrution of F[A‚ÑÑ; [B‚ÑÑF in the ase A;B have rst
ations, (hi; I) and (hi; J). For i 2 I (resp. j 2 J) let A
i
(resp. B
j
) be the subdesign of A
(resp. B) whose base is i ` (resp. j `). For I 2 }
f
(N) let F
I
be the subdesign of F whose
base is ` I (with the onvention that F
I
= Fid when the premise ` I is missing). F[A‚ÑÑ and
[B‚ÑÑF will be dened by means of their subdesigns F[A‚ÑÑ
K
and [B‚ÑÑF
K
of bases ` K for eah
ramiation K, and again some of these subdesigns may be partial, i.e., missing.
F[A‚ÑÑ
K
: Form a ut-net between F
I[K
and the A
i
in I  K ; its base is ` K and its normal
form, partial or total, is F[A‚ÑÑ
K
. The equation
 F j A<B = F[A‚ÑÑ j B follows from the onstrution of F[A‚ÑÑ
J
and the deni-
tion of normalisation.
[B‚ÑÑF
K
: Form a ut-net between F
J[K
and the B
j
in J ; its base is ` K J , and its normal
form, partial of total, denes [B‚ÑÑF
K
, up to the detail that the base must be hanged
to ` K, just a matter of replaing in every hronile the initial ation (hi;K   J) with
(hi;K). The equation  F j A<B = A j [B‚ÑÑF follows from the onstrution of
[B‚ÑÑF
I
and the denition of normalisation.
Remark 12. Like in -alulus, we have a type-free notion of appliation of a funtion to
an argument ; however, there are important dierenes :
F The argument an be applied to the left or to the right, yielding dierent results.
F The funtion must be negative and the argument positive, yielding a negative output.
F Appliation is a total operation : F[A‚ÑÑ is always dened (sine negative).
Exerise 8. Show that the tensor produt
37
annot be extended to the partial design Fid
and still admit adjoints.
Proposition 9. The operation < is assoiative and its neutral element is One, see (39)
p. 32.
Corollary 9.1. F?A i the hronile h(hi; ;)i belongs to F[A‚ÑÑ (equivalently to [A‚ÑÑF).
Proof.  F j A<One = F[A‚ÑÑ j One , et.
Corollary 9.2. F[A‚ÑÑ[B‚ÑÑ = F[A<B‚ÑÑ, [A‚ÑÑ[B‚ÑÑF = [A<B‚ÑÑF, [B‚ÑÑ(F[A‚ÑÑ) = ([B‚ÑÑF)[A‚ÑÑ.
In partiular the notation [B‚ÑÑF[A‚ÑÑ is not ambiguous.
Proof. For instane the last equation :
 [B‚ÑÑ(F[A‚ÑÑ) j C = F[A‚ÑÑ j C<B = F j A< (C<B) =
 F j (A< C)<B = [B‚ÑÑF j A< C = ([B‚ÑÑF)[A‚ÑÑ j C

there exists a unique negative design (F)A (not depending on B), suh that
 F j AB = (F)A j B (67)

Remark 13. In ludis, the appliation of a funtion to an argument (ommutative ase)
38
is independent of the order. This is beause everybody gets a loation. In usual spiritual
logi, f(a) means that a has been deloated so as to be put in front of f , and f(a)(b); f(b)(a)
are denitely distint (i.e., not isomorphi). Here, the arguments arry their own loations,
so no possible mismath. Coming bak to our air plane, the usual way is say to ll
the rows from 1A to 13D
39
. Then appliation of passengers to the air plane depends on the
order of registration, but this is rational, i.e., spiritual. From the loative viewpoint, every
passenger omes with a denite seat and their order of appearane is irrelevant provided we
adopt the ommutative protool.

5.2. Completeness properties
5.2.1. The projetion lemma What follows is alled a lemma, for it is used in so many plaes.
This is in fat one of the deepest results of the theory, the essential key to ompleteness.
Let X  N be a reservoir. Any positive design A with rst ation (hi;K) an uniquely be
written as a tensor produt D
B
41
of a design D starting with (hi;K \ X) and a design
B starting with (hi;K   X).
Denition 37 (Projetion). The design D just introdued is alled the projetion of A
on X and noted AX ; we also dene DaiX = Dai. If E is an ethis, fAX;A 2 Eg is alled
the projetion of E on X and noted EX.
Theorem 19 (Projetion). Assume E onneted ; then projetion ommutes with biorthog-
onal :
E
??
X = (EX)
??
.
Proof. Let (hi;K) be the rst ation of E ; w.l.o.g. we assume that
X = I  K ; we must prove two inlusions :
E
??
I  (EI)

: Let F 2 (E  I)

; assuming F material, we an replae its unique
rst negative ation (hi;I) with (hi;K), so as to get F

(in other terms, we are A using
weakening B). If D = AI , it is immediate that  A j F

5.2.2. Independene Independene is a weak form of spirituality, whih entails ompleteness.
Denition 38 (Independene). Two behaviours G;H of the same polarity are said to
be independent when the following holds : if I; I
0
2 {G and J; J
0
2 {H are suh that
I [ J = I
0
[ J
0
, then I = I
0
; J = J
0
.
Let ~ be any of the tensors so far dened ; all denitions are of the form
G~H = fA~B;A 2G;B 2 Hg
??
(87)
So let G

H = fA~B;A 2G;B 2 Hg.
Theorem 20 (Independene property). If G;H are positive and independent, then
G

H is a omplete ethis for H = G~H.
Proof. Write G

H =
S
K
(
S
I[J=K
G

H
J
). By the disjuntion property, theorem 11,
p. 40, we are redued to showing that
S
I[J=K
G
I

H
J
is a behaviour. But the indepen-
dene property preisely tells us that this union redues to the simple form G
I

H
J
, i.e.,
the theorem redues to the onneted ase, so let's assume G;H onneted.
~ =  : If I; J are not disjoint, then GH = 0. If I; J are disjoint, and if
A = DB 2 GH, then D 2 G =G
??
and B 2 H = H
??
by the projetion
lemma 19, p. 49, so A = DB 2 G

H.
~ = < : G

H = (GK J)

H. By the projetion lemma 19, p. 49, (in fat the seond
half of the proof) GK J is a behaviour, and we are redued to the ase I; J disjoint,
already treated.
~ = : : We easily obtain
G:H = (GI J)

>

(HJ I) (88)
The entral part is a positive skunk, whose only material inhabitant is Sk
(hi;I\J)
. From
this we get jG:Hj = G

H (in the previous ases, the inarnation was not needed :
we diretly got G~H =G

H).
5.2.3. Usual multipliatives
Denition 39. Two behaviours G;H of the same polarity are alien when their reservoirs
do not interset, i.e., when xG \ xH = ;.
Alienation is an important loative hypothesis, sine :
F It makes the four multipliatives ollapse into a single one, 
.
LOCUS SOLUM 51
F It ensures independene, and the ompleteness property attahed to it.
Moreover, the onnetive 
 and its dual P
42
, whih are partial, get total variants, whih
only satisfy the properties up to isomorphism.
5.2.4. The logial onstant 1 However something must be notied : alienation does not imply
disjuntion, i.e., xG\xH = ; does not imply {G\{H = ; : this is due to the empty rami-
ation. Hene the behaviour 1 will be problemati, sine it is self-alien, but not self-disjoint.
In partiular when in the style of subsetion 4.2.2, p. 38 we use the deloations ';  , 1
remains unhanged, for '(;) = ;. In other terms 1 annot be treated like a usual formula,
sine '(1)  (1) is not dened, and we are not at all austomed to partial onnetives !
To sum up, linear logi has no real multipliative units ! Indeed this is not surprising, this
is just the fat that one annot dene proof-nets for neutral elements without A tying B
the weakenings, see (Girard, 1996). But tying the weakenings is the same as loating the
neutrals, whih annot be loated, if they are quite neutral. Old linear logi reated neutral
elements on the basis of approximate ategorial isomorphisms, but these isomorphisms are
wrong.
Of ourse booleans an no longer be dened by 1 1, but there is the possibility of lose
variants like '(U)  (U), where U is the biorthogonal of the design :

follows we investigate them from a dierent spirit, and this is why we hange our notations.

One should not believe that this is a ategory of positive behaviours ; in reality the objet G stands for
G and its negation.

Winning is dened in setion 8.1, p. 67. If you don't know what winning is about, just ignore it : requiring
morphisms to be winning has to do with preservation of. . . winning, i.e., truth.
LOCUS SOLUM 53
Here omes a deliate point of terminology : one of the disoveries of ludis is that the word
A quantier B say universal orresponds to two ompletely dierent approahes that the
tradition ould hardly separate.
First-order quantiation : A big onjuntion, maybe uniform in some sense : this is
the viewpoint of model-theory, of German style proof-theory, et.
Seond-order quantiation : An intersetion : this is the viewpoint of the forgetful
interpretation of system F, and the one we adopt here.
The rst-order approah is spiritual (i.e., involves a lot of deloations and is up to iso-
morphism), whereas the seond-order approah is loative. The dominant approah to logi
being spiritual, the tendeny was to try to treat seond-order quantiation as poor relative
of rst-order quantiation. . . to the extent that one hardly understands why the rst-order
ase is omplete (or enjoys the subformula property) and the seond order ase is inom-
plete ! Denitely the word A quantier B is not at all used in the same sense in these two
ourrenes. . . unfortunately, it is too late to produe neologisms that would distinguish the
two uses !
In this monograph, we shall not be onerned with rst-order quantiation, although the
hapter on uniformity introdues the material that should sue to dene a uniform onjun-
tion. We shall only onsider the quantier-as-intersetion, whih orresponds, in dereasing
order of interest to the following ases :
Higher-order quantiation : The seond-order ase and its straightforward generalisa-
tions to third-order, fourth-order, et.
Intersetion types : Typially a binary intersetion, usually arefully kept aside from
logi for want of any spiritual (truth values, ategorial models, et.) interpretation.
First-order quantiation : We an try to mistreat rst-order quantiation and treat
it in our spirit, i.e., as an intersetion indexed by the domain of interpretation. This
plain treason is not worse than the urrent habit to treat seond-order quantiation as
a big onjuntion
45
: it will ause the failure of ompleteness, but bring prenex forms as
a ompensation, so it might be worth to try and see.
Let us summarise : there are two diverging traditions as to quantiation, one spiritual,
one loative loative before the expression was reated. In this setion, we investigate the
loative quantier, i.e., the quantier whih does not follow the truth tables, whih ignores
ategory theory. The question is lear : does this beome a mess, or do we get something nie
out of it ? In fat something wonderful arises from the unexpeted shok between loative
quantiation and spiritual onnetives : these operations ommute sometimes beyond
what seems reasonable, i.e., up to the violation of ertain lassial priniples.
These ommutations indue prenex forms : typially any seond-order proposition inMALL
2
(logi without exponentials
46
) is equal to its prenex form, e.g., (8XP [X ‚ÑÑ)
 (Q& 9Y R[Y ‚ÑÑ)
is literally the same as 8X9Y (P [X ‚ÑÑ 
 (Q & R[Y ‚ÑÑ) and 9Y 8X(P [X ‚ÑÑ
 (Q & R[Y ‚ÑÑ). This is
potentially of tremendous interest.
As usual the base is ` hi or hi `.

6.1.1. Universal quantiation
Denition 42. Let G
d
be a family of behaviours of the same polarity, indexed by a set D
of any ardinality. Then we dene 8d 2 D G
d
as the intersetion
T

G

.
The indexing set an be of any ardinality, typially 0 (yielding thus >

), 2 (an interse-
tion type), 
0
(rst-order quantiation) 2

0
(seond-order quantiation). The index set is
spiritual, i.e., is only up to bijetion ; a more exat sine loative, but less onvenient
notation would be 8X here X is a set of behaviours. When we feel relaxed and nobody from
algebrai logi is lurking around, we just write 8d.
6.1.2. Existential quantiation
Denition 43. Let G
d
be a family of behaviours of the same polarity, indexed by a set D
of any ardinality. Then we dene 9d 2 D G
d
= (
S
d2D
G
d
)
??
.
The life of the unfortunate existentials will be diult : there is no deent way to give a
omplete ethis for 9d. When the index set I is something like the set of all behaviours
i.e., seond-order quantiation, then Cantor's theorem
47
will badly annoy you.
But existential inompleteness is of a non-enumerative nature : the existential quantier is
the arhetype, the paragon of inompleteness, but problems start already when I has two
elements, nothing to do with Pr. Dr. M√ºnhhausen and his notorious way of getting out of
water. The evidene for inompleteness lies in the politially inorret prenex forms below,
typially 9d8e('(A
d
) √Ü "'
0
(A
e
)) : there is no way to remove the biorthogonal involved in
the existential quantier, as soon as ‚ÑÑ(D )  2. If you are not onvined of the inompleteness
of 9, observe that for any ethis E we have :
E
??
= 9E 2 E fE
0
;E  E
0
g (95)
In other terms, the biorthogonal is nothing but an instane of the existential quantier, and
if inompleteness exists, the existential quantier must be blamed for it.
6.2. Shoking equalities and prenex forms
6.2.1. The ommutation theorem
Theorem 22 (Commutation). 8d ommutes with all operations, but 9 ; in partiular
ludis admits prenex forms.
Basially 8 ommutes with all omplete onnetives. The general idea is to use the omplete-
ness of the ethis G
d
to replae 8dG
d
??
with 8dG
d
: everything is almost immediate. The
proof is a list of ases of unequal interest. The most important ommutations are 8= (du-
ally 9=&) and 8=
 (dually 9= P). Indeed the theorem only states the unary ommutations,
e.g. :
8d(G
d
H) = (8dG
d
)H (96)
but we in fat get double ommutations so strong that the ommutation 8= even on-
tradits lassial logi !
47
It is funny to see that G√∂del's theorem, whih was anyway inspired from Cantor's theorem, returns to
the original matrix.
LOCUS SOLUM 55
The theorem has been phrased in a very harming hand-waving style, but one has to be
preise about its ontents. I take one example, preisely the ommutation 8=. Here the
onnetive  is the plain spiritual one, namely
GH = ('(G) [  (H))
??
(97)
where the deloations ';  have been introdued p.34. In partiular, when we formG
d
H
d
,
the deloations at work are independent of d. This is not a trik, this is :
F The most natural thing to do.
F The only reasonable one : think that the default D is the domain of the seond-order
quantier, i.e., the set of all behaviours, whose ardinality is likely to be 2
2

0
, whereas
there at most 2

0
deloations, and 
0
pairwise disjoint deloations.
F Reminisent of plain realisability : the realiser of a disjuntion is of the form 1  r or
2  r, where the numbers 1; 2 are xed deloations of r. . . and, b.t.w., the intuitionisti
impliation 8X(A[X ‚ÑÑ _ B[X ‚ÑÑ)) (8XA[X ‚ÑÑ) _ (8XB[X ‚ÑÑ) is realisable.
Tehnially speaking, the ommutation rests on two pillars :
F The disjuntion property, theorem 11, p. 40, whih enables one to remove the biorthog-
onal in (97).
F The fat that the reservoirs X = '(N) and Y =  (N) are disjoint, hene the two disjunts
are learly distinguished by the splitting N  X [ Y.
For notational simpliity we shall ome bak to our usual onventions (see subsetion 4.2.2)
and don't use the deloations ';  . This means that we assume that, for all d 2 D
xG

Existential quantiers do not enjoy the existene property, but who ares ? The useful
existene property deals with numerial quantiation whih is not a quantier in our
sense and whih enjoys the existene property.
Unfortunately, it is unlikely that prenex forms persist at least in this straightforward
form for exponentials. The reason is simple, this would imply the equality
8d::G
d
= ::8dG
d
. But surely (we forget shifts, deloations et.) we have 8X::(X:X),
and we would obtain ::(8X X  8X :X), a ontradition.
6.3. Usual quantiers
6.3.1. First-order quantiation Our notion of a rst-order quantier is very simple, just
take an innite denumerable domain D , and onsider behavioural prediates, i.e., families of
behaviours of the same base indexed by D . The most typial suh family is equality, a binary
prediate :
Denition 44 (Equality). For d; d
0
2 D , we dene the positive behaviour=
d;d
0
F =
d;d
0
:= 1 if d = d
0
.
F =
d;d
0
:= 0 if d 6= d
0
.
Our approah to rst-order is extremely simple, but ontradits the tradition of prediate
alulus, just think that prenex forms like
9d8e('(G
d
) √Ü "'
0
(G
e
)) (115)
are not aepted in usual rst-order logi, not to speak of
8d(G
d
H
d
) = (8dG
d
) (8dH
d
) (116)
So there is a mismath between the tradition and ludis.
6.3.2. Seond-order quantiation We only onsider seond-order propositional quantia-
tion. Seond-order prediate quantiation is already a higher-order quantiation and does
not deserve an independent reetion.
A propositional variable stands for the unknown behaviour. However ertain details must
be laried :
Jean-Yves Girard 58
Polarity : Either a variable ranges over all positive behaviours, or it ranges over all nega-
tive behaviours. We deide that propositional variables range over positive behaviours :
negations of variables will range over negative behaviours, and there is no loss of gener-
ality.
Loation : In usual syntax a given variable ours several times, both positively and neg-
atively, whih means that our unknown behaviour has several loations, whih is impos-
sible. So we deide that variables range over positive behaviours of base ` hi. Various
ourrenes will be handled through appropriate deloations.
Quantiation : Seond-order quantiation 8G and 9G are just intersetions indexed
by this spei set of behaviours.
For instane the design of subsetion 5.2.5, p. 51, belongs to 8G('(G) √Ü "'
0
(G)).
Observe that nobody fores us to quantify over A all B behaviours. We ould for instane
quantify over all A subtypes B of a given behaviour, i.e., form 8G H
0
[G‚ÑÑ et. We ould
as well restrit to behaviours enjoying ertain peuliarities. For instane it an be useful to
quantify over those behaviours G whose diretory {G does not ontain ;, what we shall do
in hapters 9.1- 10.
Seond-order quantiation diers in spirit from the rst-order ase : G√∂del's theorem shows
that inompleteness should be expeted as soon as seond-order existentials our. So there
is nothing to x with our prenex forms, as long as we deal with seond-order : these prenex
forms give rise to impliations involving seond-order existentials, and the inompleteness of
suh formulas is expeted. The only novelty w.r.t. G√∂del is that we don't need to diagonalise
to get an artiial ounterexample, we have just natural, immediate, and useful ounterex-
amples to ompleteness.
6.3.3. Higher-order quantiation
(higherorder-my-file 'subsetion "6.3.2").
7. Uniformity
Certain logial onnetives (exponentials, spiritual quantiation
48
) are uniform : this means
that the fat that two designs are A similar B for instane isomorphi plays a role in the
denition of the onnetive. Nothing so far introdued is able to ope with uniformity.
What is essentially missing is the possibility of equipping a behaviour with a partial equiv-
alene relation, a A PER B :
Denition 45. A partial equivalene relation (PER) on a set X is a binary relation

7.2.2. Biinarnation
Denition 51 (Bihaviours). A bihaviour is a biethis (G;

=
) equal to its biorthogonal.
Example 25. By proposition 16.1, p. 60, (G;
G
) is a bihaviour whenG is a behaviour : this
shows that the new notion enompasses the old one. In partiular the onstants 0;1;?;>
an be seen as bihaviours. Besides ordinary behaviours, bihaviours enable one to speak of
the A symmetri sum B, see subsetion 7.3.4, the A symmetri tensor produt B, see 7.4.4.
See also subsetion 7.2.3 below.

Proof. Easy exerise.
Denition 52 (Biinarnation). If (G;

=
) is a bihaviour and D

=
D 2 G
p
, its biinarna-
tion kDk is the smallest design E 2 G
p
suh that E  D and D

=
E. A design equal to its
biinarnation is said to be bimaterial or biinarnated .
Remark 15. The existene of the biinarnation is an immediate appliation of the stability
theorem 3, p. 28. Moreover, sine D

=
jDj, we get
kDk  jDj  D (124)
Also, if kDk  E  D, then kEk = kDk.
7.2.3. The singleton bihaviour The next example shows that the prinipal behaviour D
??
an be equipped with a PER suh that D is the only total design equivalent to itself. The
property plays a ruial role in the uniformity lemma, theorem 30, p. 80.
Proposition 19. Let D be a design of base ` hi. Then one an form a bihaviour (D



suh that :
1 If E 2 D

7.3. Additives
In what follows, the base is atomi, ` hi or hi `.
7.3.1. Diretory of a bihaviour
Denition 53. If (G;

=
) is negative, a diretory N is saturated w.r.t.(G;

=
) when Dir
N
is
bimaterial in (G;

=
).
Theorem 23 (Bidiretory). If G is negative, there exists a PER 
G
50
on {G suh that
the diretories whih are saturated w.r.t. (G;

=
) are exatly the sets N whih an be written
as unions
S
N
k
of equivalene lasses modulo 
G
.
50
The orret notation would be 
(G;

=

.
Jean-Yves Girard 62
Proof. If (G;

=
) is negative, say that two ramiations I; I
0
are related when there exist
partial designs E;E
0
2 G
?
p
whose respetive rst ations are (hi; I); (hi; I
0
) and suh that
E

=
?
E
0
. Dene the PER 
G
on {G as the transitive losure of the relation A to be related B.
The remainder of the proof heavily rests upon the remark that when the positive E starts
with (hi; I) JDir
N
;EK onverges i I 2 N .
F If Dir
N
6

=
Dir
N
, then there are equivalent E;E
0
2 G
?
p
suh that
 Dir
N
j E 6=  Dir
N
j E
0
 , and it is immediate that E;E
0
are distint from
Dai;Fid ; if (hi; I); (hi; I
0
) are the respetive rst ations of E;E
0
, then I 2 N i I
0
62 N .
If Dir


=
Dir
N
, but Dir
N
is not bimaterial, then there exist I 2 N suh that
Dir
N

=
Dir
N fIg
. Then no E 2 G
?
p
starting with (hi; I) an be related to itself.
F If Dir
N
is bimaterial, then it is easily shown to be losed under the relation A to be
related B, moreover, if I 2 N is related to nothing, then Dir
N

=
Dir
N fIg
.
Corollary 19.1. Assume that G is negative ; then the support G of 
G
is haraterised
by the equation
kDai
 
k = Dir
G

7.3.2. Loative additives As in hapter 4, p. 36, we an dene general loative additives. The
novelty is the denition of the relation


F (

) is its biorthogonal.
The exat analogues of propositions 5, p. 37, and 6, p. 37, hold for our onnetives.
Only part of the results of subsetion 4.1.5, p. 38, remain : 
T
-
k
G
k
is the transitive losure
of the union
S
k

G
k
(the same for 
U
k
G
k
). But there is no way to ompute 
p
k
G
k
from
the 
G
k
: typially I may be related to itself w.r.t. the positive (G;

=
) beause of some
designs D

=
D, and related to itself w.r.t. (G;

=
0
) beause of some designs D
0

=
0
D
0
, but
the intersetion of the set of the D and the set of the D
0
may be empty.
7.3.3. The additive deomposition As in hapter 4, p. 36, the symbols ;& are restrited to
disjoint diretories. A say positive bihaviour G is onneted when it is distint from 0
and annot be written as a non-trivial  of two bihaviours. Indeed onneted bihaviours fall
into two ases :
F Those bihaviours (G;

=
) suh that {G 6= ; and I 
G
J for all I; J 2 {G.
F Those bihaviours (G;

=
) suh that {G is a singleton fIg and I 6
G
I .
Then any positive bihaviour an be written in a unique way as a  of onneted bihaviours.
Example 26. Let us give some example of diretories with their PER :
1 The basi ase of a behaviour seen as a bihaviour orresponds to equality : I 
G
J
i I = J 2 {G. The additive deomposition of a behaviour as a bihaviour oinides with
the familiar one.
2 If the negative G is suh that D

=
G
D
0
for all D;D
0
2 G, then kDai
 
k = Sk and the
PER 
G
has empty support.
3 In subsetion 7.3.4 below, assume that G is a plain behaviour. Then 
H
is the total
equivalene relation on '({G) [  ({G) whose lasses are the sets f'(I);  (I)g.

7.3.4. An example : Symmetri sum Our basi example should be the basi instane of

F It is enough to dene the relation

7.4. Multipliatives
In what follows, the base is atomi, ` hi or hi `.
7.4.1. Loative multipliatives Multipliatives are better handled in the negative ase. For
any of our onnetives ./;n;o; 1 , one must dene a PER. We shall onentrate on ./ and
dene the bihaviour (G ./H;

=
G./H
).
Denition 54. If (G;

=
G
); (H;

=
H
) are negative, we dene F

=
G./H
G by
8A;B (A

=
G
?
B) (F)A

=
H
(G)B ) (131)
Using ((F)A)A
0
= ((F)A
0
)A. . . (equation (68), p.46) the right hand side of the impliation
an be rewritten :
8A
0
;B
0
(A
0

=
H
?B
0
) (F)A
0

=
G
(G)B
0
) (132)
From this it is easy to prove the analogue of theorem 16, p. 48. The same holds for the other
multipliatives.
7.4.2. Completeness properties Completeness an only be stated under the hypothesis of
alienation, i.e., xG \ xH = ; ; in this ase we introdue the symbols 
;P.

is immediate. The
onverse an be proved by the A weakening B tehnique used in theorem 19, p. 49.
7.4.3. Multipliatives and diretory We shall ompute the diretory of the tensor produt of
alien behaviours.
Proposition 21. If G;H are positive and alien, if I; I
0

(134)
Proof. Easy onsequene of proposition 20.
7.4.4. An example : Symmetri tensor produt We present here a small, but important part
of the exponential
51
, i.e., the symmetri tensor produt. Let (G;

=
G
) be a positive bihaviour,
then dene (H;

=
H
) by H = '(G)
  (G). and
'(D) 
  (E)


Although it is only a toy example, the next theorem is important : the same mahinery
ould work mutatis mutandis in the ase of exponentials.
Lemma 24.1. Let  be the deloation
(3i  ) = (3i+ 1)   ; ((3i+ 1)  ) = 3i   (136)

Proof. Easy sequene of veriations.
Theorem 24 (Uniformity). (H;


H
) is a bihaviour.
Proof. Sine


'(G)
 (G)
is ner that




H
?? . If
'(D)

)
  (E
0
), then D

=
G
D
0
, E

=
G
E
0
. By the lemma, we also get
'(E) 
  (D)

=
H
?? '(D

)
  (E
0
), from whih we onlude that E

=
G
D
0
: hene the four
designs D;D
0
;E;E
0
are equivalent w.r.t.

=
G
. The two PER that

=
H
??
and

=
H
are therefore
equal.
The material designs in (H;

positive bihaviours (G




) of respetive bases `  for  2 ;, then one must take the

It is possible to prove the exat analogues of the results of theorem 21, p. 52 :

It is useful to nd the analogue of the PER  in suh a ase. For this we need to dene
{ ` , and 
`
. Two ases :
Negative base : If  2 , then { `  = {G

and 
`

G

.
Positive base : If  = ;, then { `  is the disjoint union of the {G

( 2 ) ; moreover
(; I) 
`
(; J) i  =  and I 
G

I .
The negative ase omes from a straightforward generalisation of proposition 19.1, p. 62.
The positive ase is a onsequene of an important property :
Proposition 22. Assume thatD


`
E andD;E have respetive rst ations (; I); (; J) ;
then  =  and I 
G

J .
Proof. Consider for instane ` G;H ; then D


E implies that
JD;Dir

K = JE;Dir
M
;Dir
N
K for all saturated Dir
M
(w.r.t. G

) and Dir

). The PER 
`G;H
on the disjoint union {G + {H is therefore equal to the disjoint
union 
G

H
.
7.7. Bihaviours as games
We know, see subsetion 3.2.3, p. 32, that a behaviour indues a game : the design D
(or rather its inarnation) is a strategy when all disputes (plays) generated from ounter-
strategies E 2 G
?
onverge. But what about bihaviours ? It is still possible to view them as
sort of games : instead of playing a single design D, our would-be strategy will onsist of four
designs on the pro-base, (D
1
 D
0
1
;D
2
 D
0
2
), what we all a 4-design. This onstrution is
only of oneptual interest and will legitimate the denition 56, p. 67 of uniformity, whose
eet is preisely to redue a 4-design to a familiar design.
We dene orthogonality of 4-designs :

Denition 55. The 4-designs (D

with D

In setion 8.1.1 we shall be onerned with winning onditions. One of these onditions
is uniformity : from the viewpoint of Proponent, whose strategy is (D

),
the four disputes [D

means that the blame an be put on Opponent in ase they dier, e.g., when JD

;E

K di-
verges : the rst time any two of these disputes dier is due to a dierent ation (or absene
of ation) of Opponent. If we onsider ounter-4-designs of the form (;  E

fores using exerise 5, p. 32 jD

Now take a general ounter-4-design (E

We have therefore shown that, up to inarnation and biinarnation, a uniform 4-design an
be written (kDk  D; kDk  D) for some inarnated D suh that D

=
D : eventually a
uniform 4-design redues to a single design.
8. Truth and ompleteness
The traditional meaning of ompleteness relates truth with provability : this is external
ompleteness. Our task is therefore to dene truth and then to prove its adequation w.r.t.
a formal system. In the next hapters we shall establish full soundness and ompleteness of
MALL
2
, i.e., seond-order multipliative-additive linear logi
54
w.r.t. ludis. In this hapter
we ontent ourselves with the denition and basi properties of truth.
8.1. To lose, to win
8.1.1. The losers We shall devise neessary onditions for a 4-design (D
1
 D
0
1
;D
2
 D
0
2
)
to be winning against a 4-anti-design (E
1
 E
0
1
;E
2
 E
0
2
). For this we shall fany ideal
properties of disputes ; these onditions will usually be violated, and the trespasser (in fat
the initial trespasser) will lose.
Uniformity : In a perfet world, the 4 ut-nets fD
i
;E
i
g; fD
0
i
;E
0
i
g(i = 1; 2) should on-
verge, with the same dispute. Of ourse, this an hardly be the ase, but any time two
among these 4 disputes dier, one of the players is to blame for the mismath : if the dis-
putes dier beause of Proponent (the owner of (D
1
 D
0
1
;D
2
 D
0
2
)), then Proponent
loses. If Proponent never loses for this reason, we have just established (subsetion 7.7)
that :
jD
0
1
j = jD
0
2
j; kD
1
k = kD
2
k = kD
0
1
k = kD
0
2
k (143)
i.e., up to (bi-)inarnation one an assume that the 4-design is of the form
(D  D;D  D). This is our rst ondition, uniformity : the four omponents should
be equal. Observe that if we form a net of uniform 4-designs, then the normal form
provided it exists is uniform too.
But basta with 4-designs ! If I want to win (and not only to prevent Opponent from
winning), I must play A uniformly B, i.e., I must selet four times the same design D,
and, of ourse, D must satisfy a requirement :
(D  D;D  D) 2
\
(G;

=
) (144)
Whih redues to the following :
Denition 56 (Uniformity). D 2 G is uniform when D

=
D.
This is the rst neessary ondition to be winning. Like all winning properties, it is a
property of single designs. From now on we an forget 4-designs. . .
Obstination : In a perfet world, all disputes should be innite. . . but preisely, this is
never the ase. One of the two players is to blame for that, i.e., the rst one who fails
to deliver a positive ation (in ase normalisation diverges) or the rst one who aborts
by using z : this player loses. If I want to win, I play obstinately, i.e., never ause
54
Without the multipliative onstants 1;?.
Jean-Yves Girard 68
termination. If D is material, observe that a daimon in D must be onsumed in the
normalisation of some JD;EK : the requirement translates as :
Denition 57 (Obstination). D 2 G is stubborn when it does not use the daimon
z.
Observe that if we form a net of stubborn designs, then the normal form (provided it
exists) is stubborn too.
Parsimony : In this ideal world, there should be no waste. In partiular all reated loi
should eventually be used as a fous. Observe that this priniple is hardly tenable, unless
one uses many ations (; ;) whih onsume foi without replaing them. Again the
problem is not to full the requirement, but to put the blame on Opponent, the priniple
of the barbihette. In other terms : A OK, I didn't fous on , but I was waiting until
Opponent fouses on 
0
, what he never did B, says Proponent, but he is perhaps only
pretending. . . This dialogue ours during a dispute [D
 E‚ÑÑ = S [ T. Proponent's
laim is that he an extend S into S
0
in suh a way that an ation with fous  is
performed in S
0
; the standard way to do so is to extend a maximal hronile  2 S into
  (
0
; I
0
)  (; I) 2 S
0
. But this might be impossible, typially when the pretender has
unfortunately destroyed all available loi, by toying too muh with the ramiation ;. . .
The laim of Proponent is redible if he is able to dispath the unfoused loi without
loss ; suh a dispathing is alled. . . a dessin, and A no loss B means exat rules :
Denition 58 (Exatness). With the notations of subsetion 1.2.2, p. 8, a rule is said
to be exat when
Demon : No restrition.
Positive rule :  =
S
i

i
.
Negative rule : 
I
=  for all I 2 N .
A design is exat when it admits an exat dessin, i.e., a design-dessin in whih all rules
are exat.
The typial example of an inexat design is the following (notie the use of the ramia-
tion ;) :
(h0;0i;;)
` h0; 0i; h0; 1i
(h0i;f0;1g)
h0i `
(hi;f0g)
` hi
(145)
If you are aught with this guy, don't say that you planned to fous on h0; 1i. . . To sum
up, the last neessary winning ondition is :
Denition 59 (Parsimony). D 2 G is parsimonious when for all E 2 G
?
the slie
D
E
 D whih has been onsumed during the normalisation (and dened by
[D
 E‚ÑÑ = D
E
[ E
D
) is exat.
The primal meaning of parsimony is the forbidding of the positive ation (; ;) on a non-
atomi base ` ;. But the ondition is really warped :
1 There is no simple rephrasing in terms of designs-desseins, not even in terms of designs-
dessins : the requirement that ertain slies of D are exat is not enough to ensure the
exatness of the whole D, see subsetion 10.2.1. For this reason, the full ompleteness
LOCUS SOLUM 69
theorem 32, p. 85, for MALL
2
, is slightly below the methodologial standards of this
monograph : it is proved under the assumption of exatness. I don't think that anybody
has the right to replae the interative parsimony with the non-interative exatness in
the denition 60 of winning , and this poses a small, but fruitful problem.
2 If you understand it interatively, the standard way to be parsimonious is never to use
positive ations (; ;). But what a hyporisy ! The idea is to make the number of available
foi derease, but if you never use ;, you are relying on Opponent. . .
Of all the notions of ludis, parsimony is the one whih endeavoured the most transforma-
tions. It is not ompletely unlikely that this ondition will be eventually dropped, whih of
ourse would mean a replaement of linear logi by an ane version. This would be a way to
esape the problem due to the mismath between parsimonious and exat, but there might
be more exiting solutions.
8.1.2. Winning Uniform, stubborn and parsimonious : the ideal itizen, surely not a loser . . .
Denition 60 (Winning). A design D 2 (G;

=
) is winning when it is uniform, stubborn
and parsimonious. A design is losing when it is not winning.
Theorem 26 (Winning). Winning is preserved by normalisation. For instane if D;E
are winning designs in ` (G;

=
) and (G;

=
) ` (H;

=
0
), then JD;EK is a winning design in
` (H;

=
0
).
Proof. Immediate.
Example 27. If (G;

=
) is a bihaviour, then the fax Fax
;
0
2 '(G) ` '
0
(G) is a winning
design.
Proposition 24. If D is winning, it remains winning in any super bihaviour ; its inarnation
is winning too.
Proof. Inlusion of bihaviours is dened in the obvious way (so that
D

=
G
D ) D

=
G
0
D). The losure of winning under inarnation is obvious too, e.g.,
D

=
D) jDj

=
jDj, see proposition 18, p. 60.
8.1.3. Truth and falsity
Denition 61 (Truth). A bihaviour G is true when it ontains a winning design, false
when G
?
ontains a winning design.
Corollary 26.1. G;G
?
annot be both true ; (hene they annot be both false).
Proof. If D;E are winning in respetively G;G
?
, then the normal form
JD;EK = Dai is winning, in partiular stubborn. . .
Remark 17.
F Most bihaviours will be neither true nor false. Obstination is the only exlusive ondition,
i.e., two orthogonal designs annot be both stubborn : this ondition is in harge of a
traditional but overestimated aspet of logi, namely onsisteny.
F The inarnation of a winning design remains winning. As a onsequene of proposition 24,
p. 69, truth is preserved by super-typing, falsity is preserved by subtyping.
Jean-Yves Girard 70
F More generally if D is a morphism see denition 41, p. 52 from G to H and G is
true then H is true ; if H is false then G is false : this is the reason why we requested
morphisms to be winning.
8.2. Logial Interferene
8.2.1. Is lassial logi A stronger B ? There is a spiritual prejudie that says A you annot
do better than lassial logi B. If a formula A is provable, then it remains provable when its
onnetive are interpreted A lassially B, i.e., all onjuntions are read as ^, all disjuntions
as _, exponentials as the identity. The reason is that linear and intuitionisti onnetives
are distinguished by a spei maintenane of strutural rules
55
, whereas lassial logi is
more liberal. To say it rudely, when you don't know if a thing is true, rst try lassially
and then rene if it works. This is why illiterate people sometimes say that intuitionisti
or linear logi are A weaker B than lassial logi.
This was before loative phenomenons were dislosed. To see that something new ours,
observe that 8d(A
d
B
d
) is equal to (8dA
d
)  (8dB
d
), ontraditing the lassial rules for
disjuntion : additive (and intuitionisti) disjuntion enjoy strong non-lassial priniples.
So the question is the following : we have a notion of truth, whih does not follow lassial
logi ; an we nd examples in whih truth behaves ontraditorily to truth tables ?
In what follows, we onsider the loative onjuntion , and produe aberrant truth tables.
This shows the existene of a logial interferene due to the sharing of loi.

9. Soundness of MALL
2
In this hapter we disuss the tehnial issues of ompleteness and soundness in their full
external aeptation. The syntax forMALL
2
is introdued and full soundness is established.
9.1. Full ompleteness and soundness
9.1.1. The restrited formulation The shizophreni tradition of the XX
th
entury used to
present logi through the adequation between reality (syntax) and thought (semantis) 
sorry, reality (semantis) vs. thought (syntax) :
Soundness : If the formula A is provable, then A is true in all models.
Completeness : If the formula A is true in all models, then A is provable.
The formulaA is supposed to be rst-order. Indeed A is not losed, sine it ontains prediate
or propositional parameters. If we remark that say A[P ‚ÑÑ ) B[P;Q‚ÑÑ is provable i
8X8Y (A[X ‚ÑÑ) B[X;Y ‚ÑÑ) is provable, whereas the same A[P ‚ÑÑ) B[P;Q‚ÑÑ is true in all models
i 8X8Y (A[X ‚ÑÑ) B[X;Y ‚ÑÑ) is true, we get a more satisfatory formulation
Soundness : If the losed formula A is provable, then A is true.
Completeness : If the losed 
1
formula A is true, then A is provable.
Observe that soundness holds for all losed A, whereas ompleteness must be restrited to

1
formulas, i.e., formulas in whih seond-order quantiers are universal. The seond-order
translation of arithmeti, using the Dedekind denition of natural numbers, shows that 
1
roughly orresponds to what we all
0
1
, whereas the dual lass
1
orresponds to
0
1
, a lass
of formulas known sine G√∂del's rst inompleteness theorem (1931) to ontain undeidable
sentenes : the restrition to 
1
is therefore stritly neessary.
9.1.2. The full formulation The Curry-Howard isomorphism, denotational semantis, all the
ategorial tradition, up to geometry of interation and ludis, do not interpret formulas,
but their proofs. For instane, ludis will assoiate to any losed formula A a bihaviour
A and to any proof  of A a design  2 A. Moreover, ertain designs are distinguished
this is the winning onditions of denition 60, p. 69 and we obtain the formulation (full
ompleteness and soundness) :
Jean-Yves Girard 72
Soundness : If  is a proof of the losed formula A, then  is winning and 2 A.
Completeness : If A is a losed 
1
formula, if D 2 A is winning and material, then
D =  for a ertain ut-free proof  of A.
The restrition to ut-free proofs and material designs is neessary : for instaneA&B  A,
but a proof of A & B is not a proof of A. In general  is not material, think of a proof of
9XX , whih omes from a proof of some positive formula A : the inarnation jj
9XX
is
equal to Sk
+
. . . However if the formula A is 
1
, then  is material : this mathes the
ompleteness theorem. By the way there is a puzzling problem related to inarnation : it is
immediate that normalisation does not preserve inarnation, i.e., a net of inarnated designs
may normalise into a non-inarnated design ; however, inarnation is preserved in the ase
of proofs of 
1
formulas. . . is there a diret explanation of this fat ?
If we remember that truth is the existene of a winning design in A, our full formulation
admits a forgetful formulation, whih is nothing but the restrited formulation of subse-
tion 9.1.1, p. 71 ; in partiular the restrition of full ompleteness to 
1
formulas is stritly
neessary. . . by G√∂del's theorem.
9.1.3. The results Our aim is to prove full soundness and ompleteness for linear logi with-
out exponentials. The task will be arried out, with ertain limitations.
F We must remove the onstant 1 : this is beause one annot deloate the empty ramia-
tion (problems with 1 1, see subsetion 5.2.4, p. 51). For the same reason, our seond-
order quantiation will be restrited to positive bihaviours (G;

=
) suh that ; =2 {G ; if
we introdue the notation }

(N) for }
f
(N) f;g, variables range over bihaviours X suh
that {X  }

(N).
F We annot onsider rst-order quantiation, sine the existene of prenex forms on-
tradits ompleteness : the onit between ompleteness and prenex forms annot be
solved in two lines. If one absolutely needs ompleteness, one should devise another
interpretation. . . whih is beyond the limits of this monograph.
F There is a novel onnetive, namely the shift l.
9.2. The syntax of MALL
2
9.2.1. Propositions The syntax for MALL
2
that we onsider is limited to positive proposi-
tions :
P = X;Y : : : ; 0; #P
?
;P  P ;P 
 P ; 9XP
Negative propositions are impliitly handled through the left hand side of sequents.
9.2.2. Sequents
Denition 62 (Sequents). A sequent is an expression   ` ; where  ;; are nite
multisets of propositions, with the following stoup onstraint :
If the stoup  is non-empty, then it ontains exatly one formula and  
onsists only of propositional variables.
9.2.3. The alulus The sequent alulus of MALL
2
is basially a variation on the fousing
aluli of Andreoli (Andreoli and Pareshi, 1991) ; the only originality is the treatment of
the propositional variables.

9.2.4. Cut-elimination
Theorem 27. The alulus MALL
2
enjoys ut-elimination.
Proof. This is almost obvious to anybody familiar with linear logi and system F, (Girard,
1971). Of ourse, this is old-style syntax, and one must be pedanti about ourrenes,
espeially repetitions of variables on the left. . . I suppose that if you have reahed this point
it's nothing for you.
There is only one problem : when normalising a ut on an existential formula, we must
substitute a proposition P for the variable X in the premise  ; X ` ; of the left existene
rule. The problem is that when we substitute P for X in the proof  of  ; X ` ; the
A proof B 

obtained ontains sequents of the form ; P; : : : ; P ` ; whih need not satisfy

Remark 18. The alulus is even Churh-Rosser, up to permutations of negative (left)
rules and re-dispathings of irrelevant ontexts. We don't enter into this : the real guys are
the designs, not their bureauray !
9.2.5. Ane logi For tehnial reasons, and also beause this might be of independent

9.3. Loative issues
9.3.1. Summary In order to be able to prove soundness and ompleteness, we must give a
preise loation to our formulas, espeially propositional variables. But, due to the fat that
MALL
2
is spiritual like all extant logial systems the thing is not very exiting, and
maybe you an ontent yourself with a summary :
1 Eah atom reeives a loation , so that 0 is now written 0

and X is written (X) for
an appropriate deloation  suh that (hi) = .
2 Furthermore, eah proposition reeives an alternative left deloation, on the base h1i.
This alternative loation is used on the left of sequents.
Let us give some examples :

This one is just to remember that, if we are pedanti, we must indiate the loation of 0. . .
But on the left only one loation is possible, namely h1i.
9.3.2. Relative loations Aording to the general A philosophy B of ludis, there is nothing
like distint ourrenes of a single formula, only distint isomorphi formulas. This is why
we shall now dene the relative loation 
A;B
of a subformula (old style : ourrene) B of
A : if A is loated in , R will be loated in ().
F 
A;A

9.3.3. Absolute loations We should now give absolute loations to our formulas (indeed
ourrenes). Of ourse we ould do it for the full MALL
2
, but this is of no interest. The
only formulas that matter are the ones whih are used in a given proof , namely
58
1 The formulas of the onlusion.
2 The ut-formulas.
3 Their subformulas.
Let U be the tensor produt of the nitely many formulas ourring in onlusion and uts ;
for tehnial reasons, it is better to replae U with #U
?
. Then any formula P of our proof
is a well-dened subformula-as-ourrene of #U
?
and has therefore a relative loation  :
we loate P in (hi). A proposition, together with its relative (hene absolute) loation, is
alled a right proposition.
9.3.4. Left loations Unfortunately we are still not nished with loative bureauray. The
problem omes from the fat that we allow several formulas on the left in our sequent
alulus, in ontrast to what happens in ludis. Typially, the left tensor will introdue two
formulas on the left, with the same loation 0 (but with almost disjoint, see p. 34, relative
loations s√Ü
0
√Ü'; s√Ü
0
√Ü ). Worse, if we proeed upwards with a left shift rule, one of these
formulas will migrate to the right and will be loated in (s √Ü 
0
√Ü ' √Ü s)(hi) = 0    0 or in
(s √Ü 
0
√Ü  √Ü s)(hi) = 0    1, whih are both subloi of 0  .
This is why we introdue left formulas : if A has the loation  = (hi), then A
l
is the
A same B formula, deloated by means of the deloation $

from  to h1i ; the nitely many
deloations $

are taken almost disjoint : if  6= 
0
, then
$

(  i  ) 6= $

0
(
0
 i
0
 
0
) (154)
The absolute loation h1i of A
l
is disjoint from the right loations whih this is the point
about #U
?
 are of the form 0  : : : The relative loation of A
l
is the deloation $

√Ü . A
proposition, together with its left relative loation, is alled a left proposition.
58
In the ase of ompleteness, the proof  is not given, but we know its onlusion and we are looking for
a ut-free proof, hene the disussion applies.
LOCUS SOLUM 77
9.3.5. Variables Eventually, what is important is the treatment of variables, so let us make
some notational onventions :
F We use X;Y; Z for plain variables, not for what is usually alled A ourrene B.
F Eah A ourrene B of X is distinguished by a relative loation . We use the notation
(X) to speak of this ourrene.
F On the left, the A same B ourrene of X beomes
(X)
l
= 
a
(X) = $

((X)) (155)
9.3.6. Sequents We are now dealing with an extremely pedanti syntax propositions have
a preise loation, ourrenes of variables are written (X). . . and maybe it is interesting
to revisit our sequent alulus.
Denition 63 (Sequents). A sequent is an expression   ` ; where  ;; are nite
sets of propositions suh that
F   onsists of left propositions.   an naturally be written as a union  
a
; 
n
, where  
a
only onsist of left atoms, and  
n
of the non-atoms.
F ; onsists of right propositions.
F The propositions in ; have pairwise disjoint loations.
F If the stoup  is non-empty, then  
n
is empty, and  ontains exatly one proposition.
9.4. Soundness
9.4.1. Interpretation of propositions and sequents To every proposition A one assoiates a
bihaviour A: all symbols already got their interpretation. We must only larify the status of
variables : X stands for the unknown bihaviour. Hene we shall interpret X by means of a
value X, i.e., a positive bihaviour of base ` hi suh that {X  }

(N) = }
f
(N)   f;g. The
atom (X) will be interpreted by (X) ; left propositions are interpreted in the same way
(only the loation hanges) : if P has the loation , then P
l
= $

(P), in partiular
X
a
= 
a
(X). The interpretation   `; of the sequent   ` ; is the behaviour
N
 `; : for the moment, we make no dierene between   ` ; and   ` ;;.
9.4.2. Interpretation of proofs The interpretation of a proof  of   ` ; is a design
 2  `;. This design does not depend on the values given to variables. The onstrution
splits into two ases.

Jean-Yves Girard 80
10.1.1. The theorem
Theorem 29 (Completeness). Let   ` ; be a losed 
1
sequent and let D 2   `;
be a material winning design. Then there is a proof  of   ` ; suh that D = .
Proof. We need an indution loading orresponding to the ase of a general sequent :
  ` ; being 
1
(this means that   and ; are respetively made of 
1
and 
1
propositions), we dene the expression D 2   `; :
F D 2   `; means that D 2
N
  `; for any hoie of values X;Y;Z : : : for the
variables.
F When the stoup  is non-empty, then   =  
a
onsists of atoms. If V is any valuation,
then D(V) = JD;VK belongs to `; ; the additional stoup onstraint is that the rst
ation of D(V) fouses on the lous of .
The proof is by indution on the size of the sequent   ` ;, i.e., its total number of
onnetives and atoms. It onretely onsists in, given the winning D 2   `;, to pro-
due a last syntatial rule and ad ho premises for the rule, i.e., designs belonging to the
interpretations of the premises of the rule, and to apply the indution hypothesis to the
premises. The essential ingredient of the proof is uniformity. We say that
D 2   `; is uniform when D

=
 `;
D for any hoie X;Y; : : : of values for the
variables, see setion 7.6, p. 65.
The proof will onsist of several steps, some of them being independent theorems ; the proof
oupies the remainder of the setion.
10.1.2. The uniformity lemma
Theorem 30 (Uniformity lemma). Assume that D 2  
a
`;P; is uniform
61
, and that
for some valuation X;Y; : : :;V of the free variables and the atoms, D(V) starts with a
proper rule fousing on the lous  of P . Then, for any other valuations X

X

:
1 The respetive rst ations of D(V

).
2 If V

Proof.
1 Change the valuation of the variables : X;Y; : : : are now all interpreted by (>

;
>

),
the greatest positive value, whih onsists of all designs distint from One, and D

=


E
for all proper designs D;E. Then V is pointwise

=
>

-omparable to V
0
, from whih it
follows that D(V)

=
`;P
D(V
0
). We apply proposition 22, p. 65, to onlude.
2 Immediate from proposition 22.
The importane of this lemma is immense. It will be used in the treatment of all right logial
rules. Let us start with the most important appliation :
Corollary 30.1. A stubborn uniform design in D 2  
a
; `; an be obtained by a foali-
sation rule
62
.
61
Observe that P may depend on the value of the variables, think of P = X.
62
Applied to the same D, sine foalisation does not hange the interpretation.
LOCUS SOLUM 81
Proof. Selet true bihaviours as values for the variables, e.g.,>

, and stubborn elements as
values for the atoms. Then D
V
is stubborn, hene distint from Dai. It has therefore a rst
proper ation whih fouses on the lous of some P 2 . . .
10.1.3. The polymorphi lemma This is by far the most important result, whih enables one
to reonstrut the A identity B axioms.

One variable : Assume that the result holds when the only variable is X . If several vari-
ables A our B as atoms, we an set them all equal to X and we apply the result in this

One atom : Just add a dummy seond variable. . .

Zero : Does not apply, sine 0 ontains no proper design.

Let us now onsider the general ase. If P = (X), then we an apply the results of sub-
setion 10.1.3, p. 81, to onlude : the material D is equal to the design (163), p. 79, i.e., it
omes from an ane identity axiom.
Otherwise, starting with with D 2  
a

with a valuation V for the atoms : then D

Plus : The hoie between left and right might depend on the valuation. Fortunately the
uniformity lemma, theorem 30, p. 80, shows that this is not the ase.
Tensor : Assume for simpliity that  

10.1.6. End of the proof We have been able, given a winning design in   `, to indutively
onstrut premises, whih in turn orrespond to winning designs. If the size of a sequent is
the total number of its symbols, then a premise has a stritly smaller size than the onlusion
of the same rule. Hene the proess of indutively nding premises eventually stops with a
left rule for 0, or an identity axiom, and we have produed the desired proof .

Here we should ome bak to the true meaning of A winning B, i.e., plug in parsimony.
Unfortunately the result fails ; in the next theorem, A winning B means uniform, stubborn
and exat.
Theorem 32 (Completeness). Let   ` ; be a losed 

sequent and let D 2   `;
be a material winning design. Then there is a proof  of   `  suh that D = .
whih redues to showing that a proof  of MAAL
2
suh that  is exat is (modulo some
adequate re-dispathing of irrelevant ontexts) a proof of the same sequent in MALL
2
.
10.2.1. Parsimonious vs. exat An exat design is obviously parsimonious, and the intuition

Jean-Yves Girard 86
F (188) exhibits an inexat slie whih annot be onsumed during a single normalisation :
in order to do so, the ounterdesign should allow a A simultaneous B foalisation on 0; 1
in the pithfork ` 0; 1.
F (189) exhibits an inexat design with two exat slies : only one of them an be onsumed
during a single normalisation. In order to onsume both of them, the ounterdesign should
be allowed to perform two positive ations with the same fous 0.
In order to get a ompletely satisfatory result, one should therefore try to modify our
denitions so as to allow parallel ations and reuse of ations, with possible non-deterministi
aspets, due to superimposition of loi. But this is another story.
10.2.2. Proof of the theorem Let me handwave in this nal step, sine there is little in this
proof.
1 First of all we start with  whih is a proof in MAAL
2
, and  is assumed to be exat,
whih means that it an be written as a dessin D with an exat maintenane of ontexts.
2 Then, A following B D, we an reonstrut another proof 
0
, in the same MAAL
2
. Here
lies the handwaving, but one should not waste paper !
3 One eventually reahes identity axioms, whih orrespond to some sort of exat faxes. We
are redued to showing that these A weak faxes B indeed orrespond to identity axioms
of MALL
2
, what we do in the next lemma.
Lemma 32.1. The A weak fax B F introdued in (163), p.79 is exat i  
a
=  = ;.
Proof. We only hek the neessity of the ondition : assume that one of  
a
; is non-empty ;
then the rule (; 
0
(I)) of the display (163) is inexat, whih does not mean that there is no
alternative dessin of the same with an exat maintenane. But then one lous, say , of the
missing ontext is dispathed to one of the premises, say assuming that 0 2 I the one
of index 
0
(0) : this yields the alternative premise

whih denitely ontains an inexat rule, namely (1  

 Abdution
It is fun to read Conan Doyle, but the logial method onsisting in deduing the hypotheses
from the onlusion hardly works in real life. . . unless you know the answer in advane. So-
alled A abdution B is by far the worse paralogi. It seems that the basi mistake lies in a
onfusion between the atual sense of rules (upwards) and their formal writing (downwards).

Notations, Numerology, Paralogis, Proof-searh, Sense of rules, Sherlok Holmes.
 Abstration
Abstration onsists in treating things not as they are, but as they should be. Typially,
when I replae a Mihelin XH1 TL 86H with a XH1 TL 86H, I am not replaing a thing with
its exat opy, I am just mathing a speiation. The new tire is dierent from the one it
replaes, but it behaves in the same way, as long as I use it as a tire ; dierenes, like this
small hange of olour, do not matter. Observe that the speiations of tires are suiently
preise so as to allow the replaement of only one of your two front tires with another of the

This applies to industry, whih deals say not with food, but with the idea of food, think
of M Donald's. Craft deals with objets as they are, no replaement is possible. . . for the
best and for the worse.
Abstration should not be onfused with spiritualism, whih is just abstration from loation.

 Ation
What plays the role of a logial rule in ludis, esp. in desseins : its form is (; ; I), where  is
the polarity (usually omitted),  is the fous, and I the ramiation. This basially means
something like A A formula of polarity  loated in , has been reated by means of a logial
rule involving immediate subformulas of polarity   loated in the   i for i 2 I B. Observe
that neither the rule nor the formulas matter. Eah ation omes with its opposite, obtained

There is also an improper ation, the Daimon.

 Adjuntion
One of the main properties of designs is assoiativity of ut-elimination, i.e.,
JJD;EK;FK = JD;E;FK. This property indues in turn the existene of two adjoints for eah
tensor produt : for instane < has two adjoints whih neessarily enjoy the assoiative
equation ([B‚ÑÑF)[A‚ÑÑ = [B‚ÑÑ(F[A‚ÑÑ) and the otensor GnH an be seen either as the set of
A funtions B from G
?
to H or the set of A funtions B from H
?
to G. Without this equiv-
alene between the two adjuntions, one would be fored to require that our funtions map
G
?
into H and H
?
into G, and this would be the end of assoiativity. . . (and distribu-
tivity as well) : typially Gn (HnK) = (GnH)nK beause we an express these two
behaviours as respetively made of :
F Funtions from G
?
to HnK, whih turn out to be funtions from G
?
H
?
to K,
i.e., funtions from G
?
H
?
K
?
to 0 (the unique behaviour of base `, whih is the
dualiser).
F Funtions from K
?
to GnH, whih turn out to be funtions from H
?
K
?
to G, i.e.,
funtions from G
?
H
?
K
?
to 0.
In the rst ase, we must absolutely take our argument in G
?
, for we don't know how to
deal with arguments in G
?

H
?
.
The tensor produt is therefore built in three steps :
1 First as an ethis G

H, the set of all tensor produts of a design of G with a design
of H.
2 Then its dual, whih an be handled by the two adjuntions, and has therefore good
properties suh as assoiativity.
3 Then the real tensor produt (G

H)
??
, whih inherits the good properties of its
predual.

 Admissible rule
A rule of the form : A If A is provable, then B is provable B, a statement stritly weaker than
its ontextual version A If A is provable in ontext  , then B is provable in the same ontext B,
whih amounts at the provability of the impliation, take   = A
?
. The speiity of ludis is
LOCUS SOLUM 89
to dene logial onnetives without ontext : of ourse not all inhabitants of the behaviour
A orresponding to A are A proofs B, i.e., are winning, but winning or losing a design
D 2 A is lose to a proof of A. In partiular it is easy, using the A methods B of admissibility,
to prove inlusion between behaviours, for instane 8d(G
d
_H
d
)  (8dG
d
)_(8dH
d
), in fat
an equality. In usual intuitionisti logi, the inlusion is just an admissible rule, in ludis
66
it beomes a true impliation. This shows that usual logi is badly inomplete ; whether we
an x it by means of new priniples or this is a fundamental phenomenon, I don't know.
See : Completeness (internal), Harmony, Prenex form, Winning.
 Affine logi
We understand A ane B as the refusal of ontration, sine in the absene of ontration,
impliation is handled by means of ane funtions, whih satisfy f(a [ b) = f(a) [ f(b),
but perhaps not f(;) = ;. Suh a restrition rst appeared in a paper by Grishin (Grishin,
1982), however this was hardly more than an isolated remark, not even onneted to the
funtional view of logi. After the invention of linear logi, everybody took for granted that
there was nearby linear logi a well-dened ane logi, and this was quite true, up to
the semantis of proofs : how an we ompose a weakening on the left with a weakening
on the right ? There is a solution, namely to work with an intuitionisti version (weakening
only on the left), whih has ertain qualities, see for instane the work of Asperti (Asperti,
1998). But A intuitionisti ane B is a bit weird for a real logi.
Ludis hanges the problem, sine the ritial pair of Lafont disappears, due to polarities.
Then ane logi gets a reasonable status : the maps are real linear maps, maybe not par-
simonious. The ompleteness theorem for MALL
2
is indeed proven using an intermediate
step, namely full ompleteness for MAAL
2
, its ane version. As to the eventual status of
ane logi, I have no denite opinion. The most likely situation is that we eventually end
with a alulus in the style of the unied logi LU, (Girard, 1993), in whih ane mainte-
nane of ontext is delared, and for whih ane appliation would appear as a subtype of
usual intuitionisti impliation.

 Algebrai logi
The remark that a logial system an be seen as an algebrai struture is of some interest. It
beomes dubious when this algebrai aspet beomes prominent, to the point that A a B logi
beomes any shemati formal system enjoying some property, typially onsisteny. The al-
gebrai viewpoint ompels us to onsider that logis are A stronger B or weaker, depending on
the set of their theorems. It fores one to onsider ompleteness w.r.t. algebrai strutures,
usually isomorphi to the set of theorems, i.e., gestiulation. In general ut-elimination fails
for the A logis B based on pure algebrai onsiderations.

 Analysis and synthesis
Analysis is easy, synthesis is diult. The example of a good analysis is the eletrolysis
of water, sine water an be synthesised from its onstituents ; but what to think of the
hemial analysis of a human brain ? In other terms, one analyses in view of a possible
synthesis. For instane, if you want to understand proofs in an interative way, you may
design various games, eah of them being a possible analysis of what is a proof. . . But the
synthesis may be impossible or at least lead to artiial reonstrutions. In the ase of ludis,
a rst analysis was made by means of the idea of polarity : this yielded a rst synthesis,
(Girard, 2000). This rst synthesis helped in turn to devise a more perspiuous analysis,
with a more satisfatory synthesis.

 Answer
They are not quite needed, nay wanted. However, a question without any partial answer
would not be taken seriously : answers validate questions. By the way nobody was ever di-
retly interested in Fermat's last theorem, a simple tehnial question without the slightest
appliation. . . but whose solution indued the reation of various elds suh as algebrai
geometry. Hilbert's program, although wrong, was a good question, with A answers B like
sequent alulus, whih do not quite ontribute to the program how ould they ? but
whih are by-produts of the program. A typial good question is full ompleteness, rather
for the side eets, here the invention of ludis. And of ourse, ludis answers in its way the
original question, but only in its way.

 Armageddon
The worse sort of formalists work in so-alled artiial intelligene. These people believe that

theorem.
These people are like the notorious Capitaine N√©mo, the bitter hero of Jules Verne's 20000

 Artifiiality
A So, you are doing logi. . . you must be warped. . . B The popular opinion about logi (here,
my hairdresser, Marh 2000) seems to be shared by a good half of logiians : if something is
simple, natural, it's shy. You need 10-tuples at least for the most basi denition, and never
write an equality if you an replae it with an isomorphism ; to make the long story short,
something is logial when you don't understand it. This ult of artiiality ulminates in
bleak ompetitions of the form : A My logi is terrible. . . Sorry, mine is denitely worse ! B.

 Assoiativity
The foalisation property of Andreoli basially says that we an perform in a single step a
luster of positive operations. For instane one an write ternary rules for the A onnetive B
A
 (B 
 C), whih happen to be stritly idential to the ternary rules of the onnetive
(A 
 B) 
 C : in this way one proves assoiativity of the tensor produt. Also the same
foalisation argument would prove the distributivity of 
 over  et. In general onnetives
of the same polarity assoiate, i.e., they enjoy the expeted soialisation properties. Noth-
ing of the like happens between onnetives of dierent polarities. By the way, polarity is
distinguished in linear logi by dierent graphial styles, algebrai for positive, logial for
negative, and this long before the pregnany of polarity was dislosed. . . but the graphial
style was devised as a mnemoni for remarkable isomorphisms (suh as distributivity), whih
preisely our inside the same polarity.
There is a weaker form of assoiativity, namely that +  an be replaed (in an irreversible
way) with  +. Typial examples are
(A
 (B P C))  √Ü ((A 
B) P C) (192)
Jean-Yves Girard 92
(A
 (B & C))  √Ü ((A 
B) & (A
 C) (193)
The negative operation an be delayed. This is why we an independently of the reent
disoveries on prenex forms expand the sope of universal quantiers :
((8dA
d
)  B)  √Ü 8d(A
d
 B) when  is positive. When  is negative, this holds too, but
this is an equivalene.
Sine logi is naturally assoiative, and onnetives are about soialisation of designs, it is
impossible to build a reasonable non-assoiative logi.

 Atomi proposition
Logi easily stumbles on the explanation of logial atoms. But what is a logial atom, but
a symbol for the unknown formula, or better, the unknown positive behaviour. This means
that atoms are bound to be quantied, universally in usual syntax, existentially in usual
semantis. Typially the Fax implements X ` X for any A value B X of the unknown X .
Atoms may be problemati when used in fousing syntaxes, typially, if X is positive, the
rule for X 
X should A go further B and deompose X , whih is unknown. The tehnial
answer (see subsetion 9.2.3, p. 72) onsists in formally delaying foalisation, up to the
identity axiom.

 Behaviour
A behaviour is a sort of abstrat formula, independent of any logial system, any syntax,
any semantis. The letter G used for behaviours betrays their game-theoreti origin. How-
ever a behaviour is not a game, sine the rule of the game is given by onsensus, i.e., by
orthogonality. The A rule B of G is given by G
?
, and the A rule B of G
?
is given by G : no
external Tarskian referee is allowed. A behaviour is a set of designs equal to its biorthogonal,
period.
By the way life an be viewed as a game with no rule. An equilibrium is reahed between
Me and the outer World ; this is the output of a omplex proess, deeply rooted in personal
history. A shy person has a bigger orthogonal than an aggressive one, but after all the
fat that we are not urrently killing our enemies does not result from an absolute interdi-
tion : we don't dare, or rather we think that this is bad taste, or that there are too many of
them. . . In ivil wars, when one side starts hanging the rule, soon does the other side : if
I start to behave dierently, i.e., if I hange the rule, my rule-as-orthogonal, i.e., the outer
world starts to behave dierently.

Boots is a negative design, indeed the only material design in the behaviour?, whih is the

(Girard, 1996) : the formula?must be A physially B attahed to the proof-net, ontraditing
its alleged neutrality. But this an now be explained : the problem only ours in situations
when Boots is tensorised, typially in?
?. But then we are not dealing with the negative
behaviour ? but rather with its shift #?, whih is no longer a neutral element for the

 Brooli logis
Not as bad as paralogis, Brooli logis are dedutive. The basi idea is to nd a logial
operation or priniple not yet onsidered. . . whih is not too diult : all it Brooli. Then
the Tarskian mahinery works (here the symbol A | B stands for the syntatial Brooli) :
A | B is true if A is true Brooli B is true.
LOCUS SOLUM 95
If you are smart enough to ath this deliate point, Brooli is the meta of A | B. Brooli
is equipped with priniples that have been never yet onsidered, typially
(A | B)) (A | (B | B)) (195)
and soundness and ompleteness are proven with respet to all strutures ontaining a
onstrutor ~ enjoying
(a ~ b)  (a ~ (b ~ b) (196)
(Hint for the proof of ompleteness : onstrut the free Broolo.)
By the way Tarski is not (fully) responsible for this abusive extension of his paradigm. . . ,
originally restrited to lassial logi (for whih one an say that the paradigm is not wrong,
if not very useful), with the idea of one solid reality. The Brooli logiian, does not hesitate
to tamper with A reality B, believing that his logi is just lassial logi in a dierent universe,
admittedly weird, with the idea that, from the inside of the Brooli universe, Brooli logi
is just like lassial logi. The reality has hanged, and us, as part of reality, were unable
to notie it ! But this is wrong ; Brooli logis usually don't enjoy ut-elimination and in
spite of their relation to a hypothetial meta-Broolo, the reetion shema fails. . . and the
reetion shema is the possibility of a formal reasoning on truth in the limits asribed by
G√∂del's theorem. In other terms these A logis B are inompatible with their own A meta B.

 Brouwer
For Brouwer, logial operations suh as disjuntion and existene should ommute with
provability. Brouwer's motivation was basially subjetivisti (the A reative subjet B is the
only referene). A less ontroversial justiation is the ommon-sense remark that eventually
proofs only interat with proofs : therefore only the (impliit) ontents of proofs matters.
Of ourse this supposes some ommutation of the other logial onnetives with provabil-
ity ; onjuntion ommutes with provability already in the lassial ase. . . but negation and
impliation hardly do, and the attempt by paralogis at suh a ommutation was a total
failure, for want of any possible formalisation. However these paralogiians were illiterate
beyond any deent joke : real mathematis is not based on omplementation (yielding A not
to prove B), but on orthogonality (yielding A to prove the orthogonal B.
A muh subtler form of ommutation (Heyting's semantis of proofs) was devised ; it involves
funtions and an important hange of viewpoint : the fous is no longer on the formula but
on its proof.

Vaguely reminisent of the Liar's paradox A I am lying B, Cantor's paradox is the bizarre
statement that you annot enumerate real numbers : given a denumerable set of funtions
f
n
, the funtion n; f
n
(n)+1 denes a funtion g distint from all f
n
. The diagonal method
has been reyled in G√∂del's theorem, or the undeidability of the halting problem. It an
also be used positively to prove ompatness of ertain weak topologies. From times to times
it is refuted by a paralogiian.

 Categorial ompleteness
Several
68
full ompleteness theorems have been produed, usually for the multipliative
fragment of linear logi ; even in that limited ase, it is diult to avoid A leakage B (e.g.,
the addition of the Mix rule).
Blute and Sott (Blute and Sott, 1996; Blute and Sott, 1998) used the representation
theory of groups and Hopf algebras to give full ompleteness theorems for multipliative
linear logi (MLL + Mix) and Yetter's yli linear logi (Cyll + Mix). They interpret proofs
as dinatural transformations between multivariant funtors over a ategory of topologial
vetor spaes (in the ase of yli linear logi, the dinaturals must be equivariant with
respet to the ontinuous ation of a ertain nonoommutative Hopf algebra). The main
theorems have the form: the dinatural transformations Dinat(A;B) form a vetor spae,
with basis the ut-free proofs of A ` B. Reently, Hamano (Hamano, 2000) extended these
methods to prove full ompleteness for MLL without Mix, using a -autonomous ategory
of topologial abelian groups together with Pontrjagin duality.
See : Category, Completeness (external), Full ompleteness, Leakage, Mix, Perishable.
 Categorial semantis
Denotational semantis always yields ategorial semantis, i.e., some onrete ategory in
whih logi an be interpreted (formulas as objets, proofs of impliation as morphisms).
To my experiene, the onrete models (Sott domains, oherent spaes, hyperoherenes
et.) are more interesting than the abstrat ategorial nonsense interpretation. Typially,
interpret intuitionisti logi in arbitrary CCC (losed Cartesian ategory) ; I am afraid that
you get little more than a paraphrases of intuitionisti logi. But now take the onrete
CCC of oherent spaes (and stable maps) : intuitionisti logi is now part of a new logi,
linear logi.

 Category
Category-theory played in important role in the dislosure of the deep struture of logi :

area made me style the period 1970  2000 as the time of ategories, a period whih opened
with the Curry-Howard isomorphism. Ludis originates in this ategory-theoreti approah,
but eventually took some distane.
The limitations of ategories insofar we an judge them from the sole logial viewpoint
lies in their spiritualism, their extreme spiritualism : everything is up to isomorphism. In
partiular ategories annot explain loative logial onstrutions suh as intersetion types
or if you prefer, the ategorial viewpoint ompelled us to onsider these artifats as
non-logial. In the same way, ategory-theory annot explain the prenex forms of ludis,
whih are based on equalities and whih are denitely impossible to explain by means of
isomorphisms.
To sum up, ategory theory only presents a limited aspet of logi ; provided we realise this,
it remains a very important tool.

 Chronile
A hronile is basially a nite branh in a design, seen as a sequene of ations, so that a
design-dessein is the set of its hroniles. One an also see a hronile as a nite branh in
a proof-tree. They are lose in spirit to views.

 Churh-Rosser
The Churh-Rosser property (Churh and Rosser, 1936), originally a property of pure -
alulus, see (Barendregt, 1984), states the uniity of normal forms. The property holds for
natural dedution, proof-nets, but not for sequent alulus ; moreover the property is prob-
lemati in the lassial ase. Brooli logiians think that Churh-Rosser is just a matter
of making normalisation deterministi by artiial destrution of ritial pairs. But if we
only allow say leftmost redution, then f(a) ould normalise to b and g(b) to , whereas
g(f(a)) ould normalise to 
0
6= . In other terms Churh-Rosser is eventually about asso-
iativity.
In ludis, normalisation is Churh-Rosser in the narrow sensea deterministi normalisation
, but also in the wider assoiative sense, expressed by the losure priniple.
See : Assoiativity, Brooli logis, Classial logi, Closure priniple, Critial pair,
Cut-net, Natural dedution, Normalisation, Proof-nets, Sequent alulus.
 Classial logi
Classial logi is the logi of reality. This explains its pregnany it is so diult to depart
from realism and also its limitations. Tehnially speaking, lassial logi does not enjoy
Churh-Rosser, for deep reasons that we don't quite understand ; several hypotheses :
Non-determinism : Classial logi ould be naturally non-deterministi, but then only
an interpretation of the sort A quantum mehanis B ould math the hypothesis.
Polarisation : Classial logi ould be naturally deterministi, provided one restores a
A hidden variable B, namely polarity. In fat the system LC of (Girard, 1991) and its
subsystem the -alulus of Parigot (Parigot, 1992) are deterministi. This deter-
minism is obtained through a rationalisation of the G√∂del A ::-interpretation B, whih
beomes assoiative when polarities in a sense lose to ludis have been assoiated
to lassial formulas.
Jean-Yves Girard 98
Forget it : Classial logi ould only be a omment on some part of a proof with no
algorithmi interest. Suh a viewpoint ould be implemented in ludis by the systemati
use of plain unions and intersetions, just a shift in ase the polarity must hange, and
no deloation.
See : Classial model, Churh-Rosser, Consisteny, Double negation, Exponentials,
Polarity, Proedural logi, Realism, Shift, Weak logis.
 Classial model
The eduated proof of G√∂del's ompleteness theorem onsists in attempting at making a
ut-free proof of the formula A, see e.g., (Girard, 1987b), in a systemati way. If this fails,
the attempted proof ontains an innite branh that indues a lassial model. The branh
indues a design, provided the subformulas of A have been reasonably loated. However,
several designs may orrespond to the same lassial model : if B ^ C is false in the model,
the design must put the blame on B or C, in an exlusive way.
Classial ompleteness, although external, has an immense tehnial value, that has no
analogue of the same quality for other logial systems.
See : Classial logi, Completeness, Gestiulation, G√∂del, Herbrand model, Kripke
model, Phase semantis.
 Closed world assumption
Illiterate interpretation of logi programming : A If I annot prove A, then A is false. B
Would orrespond to 
 = z and stumbles on the halting problem, like all ideas of the
like. This nonsense gave rise to unbelievable paralogial developments, inluding transnite
A proofs B. . . A PROLOG is not stalled, just wait a minute ! B Apparently some people believe
that a mistake here the overlooking of the halting problem an be orreted by a trans-
nite iteration.
The paradigm of negation as failure is more reasonable, although still inorret.

Paralogis, Prisoners, Proof-searh.
 Closure priniple
The losure priniple basially says that normalisation an be redued to the losed ase,
i.e., that it is enough to onsider losed nets. In fat JD;EK is the unique design suh that
JJD;EK;RK = JD;E;RK for any R A losing B the system. The priniple is the ombination
of assoiativity and separation. The losure priniple is reminisent of the familiar equation
hu  (x) j yi = hx j u(y)i
whih denes the adjoint of an operator. In terms of suh equations, ludis is better behaved
than operator algebra. . .
See : Adjuntion, Assoiativity, Churh-Rosser, Composition of strategies, Separation.
 Coding
Coding is neessary in logi : it is a onvenient way to redue to only one denumerable
data type, natural numbers. Moreover, deloation whih is not a onvenient or superial
operation makes use of oding. Coding is used in G√∂del's theorem so as to get inomplete-
ness of arithmeti. However, if we replae arithmeti with a variant ontaining primitives
for syntatial operations, no oding is needed to get the theorem, whih still onveys the
full methodologial meaning of inompleteness.
LOCUS SOLUM 99
Coding is often used in logi to hide the atual onstrution behind the neutrality of num-
bers. A typial example is the paper of Gentzen (Gentzen, 1969d) proving the onsisteny of
the simple theory of types, whih amounts to onstruting a nite model for types 0; 1; : : : ; n.
Gentzen assigns abalisti numbers to proofs, but he is just evaluating a lassial formula
in the model fag; 2
fag
; 2
2
fag
; : : : and showing that logial rules preserve truth. . . Even the
great Gentzen ould indulge in numerology.
Without minimising the pratial interest of odings, one an observe that the pratie of
artiial odings orresponds to a logial ideology for whih the language is a mere bureau-
rati devie, with no intrinsi properties. The passage from the time of odings 1930 1970
to the time of ategories 1970  2000 is synthesised by the Curry-Howard isomorphism : be-
fore one would explain omputable funtions by means of odings √† la Kleene (Kleene, 1952),
later one deals with ategorial models, e.g., Sott domains. By the way, Sott domains were
still using a lot of odings, due to the absene of minimum data ; their replaement with
oherent spaes is the denite rupture with odings.

Notations, G√∂del's inompleteness, Inompleteness, Natural dedution, Numerology,
Obfusation, Od-x, Sott domain.
 Coherent spae
Coherent spaes were introdued in (Girard, 1987a) as a drasti simpliation of Sott do-
mains, exploiting the stability ondition of Berry (Berry, 1978) : the overodings at work
in Sott domains were eliminated in favor of a struture whih was muh smaller in size,
and oneptually muh simpler. The rst onsequene was to individuate a deomposition
of the intuitionisti arrow as !A  √Ü B (whih was in fat found using the arhai version
of oherent spaes, qualitative domains (Girard, 1986)). The seond onsequene was linear
negation, by far the most important disovery of linear logi, and the ompulsory door to
interativity.
Coherent spaes are dened up to isomorphism : they atually form one of the best-behaved
ategories, with all sorts of limits and an involution. Designs an be seen as liques in an
absolute oherent spae, built from disputes, but they an hardly be redued to this sole
aspet. Nevertheless, oherent spaes remain one of the main intuitions onerning logi,
so fall in the respetable ategory of treason. Among beautiful treasons in this line, let us
mention the work of Ehrhard on hyperoherenes, (Ehrhard, 1995).

 Commutativity
Commutativity is not an essential property, like assoiativity. Commutative onnetives are
simpler to handle, non-ommutative onnetives are in priniple more expressive. In ludis,
ommutativity is strit, e.g., the tensor produt really enjoysG
H =H
G ; in partiular
appliation is independent of the order of arguments : ((F)A)B = ((F)B)A. Real appliation
is sensitive to the order of arguments beause it ombines the ommutative appliation with
deloations, e.g., ((F)'(A)) (B) vs. ((F)'(B)) (A).
See : Adjuntion, Assoiativity, Non-ommutative logi, Stritness.

 Completeness : external version
Completeness originally means that nothing is missing. The expression has now the slightly
dierent meaning of the adequation of a syntax to a semantis : provability misses no valid
formula. Tehnially speaking validity is about the truth of say a proposition A in all
models ; if we quantify over all propositional variables of A so as to get a losed seond-
order proposition B = 8XA the ompleteness statement is simply that for all true losed
B, B is provable. These losed formulas are of a restrited form seond-order quantiers
are universal let us all them 

. G√∂del's inompleteness theorem basially states the
failure of his own result for 
1
formulas. . . A Voi he usite da questa lasse (

) lasiate
ogni speranza. B
Completeness an be stated for proofs : if something in a semantis-of-proofs suh as lu-
dis is semantially aepted for us the something is a winning design in the assoiated
behaviour then it must arise from a syntatial proof : this is alled full ompleteness.
Before pushing the disussion further, let us observe that this formulation admits a forgetful
version, namely that truth implies provability : the enhaned form is a priori limited to 
1
formulas.
Theoretially speaking, external ompleteness is hardly more than a good question, sine it
has no interesting orollary. But the by-produts are immense, here the reation of ludis,
and the disovery of the losers.
Pratially speaking, it is of interest to get a nite syntax for ludis. In this respet om-
pleteness issues are not that stupid, sine a omplete syntax is. . . omplete, i.e., nothing
is missing. But this is a pratial justiation, not the reognition of the pregnany of the
shizophrenia syntax/semantis.

tis, Sequent alulus, Soundness, Syntax, Trinity.
 Completeness : internal version
It is of utmost interest to remark that the lass of formulas for whih ompleteness (full or
not) works is the same as the lass of formulas enjoying the subformula property. But what is
the meaning of the subformula property ? It asserts that the set of all ut-free proofs (b.t.w.,
I forgot, full ompleteness is restrited to ut-free proofs) of a 
1
formula is independent of
the (usually higher order) logi in whih it takes plae. So to speak all proofs are already
there, nothing is missing. . . and that's the right intuition. For the rst time we see the tail
of an internal approah to ompleteness. The problem is that this internal losure takes
plae inside syntax, and there is no mathematial entity suh as syntax, only bureaurati
systems. Formulating ompleteness internally but without syntax, as the essene of ut-
elimination was therefore the task.
This has been suessful beyond all expetations, for the meaning of logi is muh better
understood now. In ludis ompleteness takes the form of the removal of the biorthogonal :
if E is an ethis we may think of those designs generated by a ut-free sequent alulus,
then E
?
plays the role of (ounter-) models, and the set of designs validated by the models is
rendered by the biorthogonal E
??
, hene ompleteness is just E = E
??
(up to inarnation).
All spiritual onnetives but seond-order existene have their own form of internal
ompleteness : for instane the disjuntion property expresses the internal ompleteness of
. External ompleteness is a orollary of internal ompleteness.

 Composition of strategies
The basi form of omposition of strategies is to make two players play against eah other.
If these players are involved in several games at the same time, this indues a ompound
strategy, but for the remaining games only. This is well expressed by the ut-rule

The omposition is ruelly missing in the arhai works of the Lorenzen shool.
Composition is the entral notion and is represented in ludis by normalisation. The losure
priniple gives a syntheti denition of omposition.

 Computer siene
Although man-made, omputer siene is the physis of logiians. In the beginning :
F Many omputer sientists didn't realise the unfeasibility of the halting problem. . . with
as result the building of various paralogis.
F More eduated people were still paying too muh attention to formal issues, with an
exessive and surrealisti emphasis on onsisteny, and the building of too many
Brooli logis.
In general omputers prompted a renewal of positivisti nonsense, artiial intelligene and
so on. But how unfair it would be to redue omputer siene to these arhai mistakes. It
is an immense soure of intuitions, let us mention non-determinism, loations, proof-searh,
streams, proess algebras. . . not to speak of the mere idea of interativity. Without omputer
siene, would there still be any room left for logi ?

 Connetive
Basially any type of soialisation of behaviours : human beings belong to lubs, politial
parties, sets, et., logial artifats use onnetives, some very useful like impliation, some
ompletely artiial like the notorious Sheer's stroke. It is not our point to judge what is
good or bad soialisation : it would be like deiding what is a good or bad mathematial def-
inition. However the most immediate onnetives have been investigated in the monograph.
Usually we have three layers for the same idea of a onnetive. First a stritly assoiative
version, then a restrited form of the same (i.e., a partial onnetive) enjoying ompleteness,
nally a deloated version of the seond form, still enjoying ompleteness, yielding a total
spiritual onnetive, no longer stritly assoiative.
See : Loative logi, Shift, Spiritual logi, Stritness.
 Consensus
Ludis orresponds to a notion of game by onsensus. This means that the rule of the game
is part of the game. In ase the normalisation diverges, there is a sort of draw, hene one is
Jean-Yves Girard 102
fored to play in a ertain way to avoid divergene. If I want Opponent to follow the rule, I
usually play a losing design to fore the onsensus.

semantis, Loser, Orthogonality, Referee, Strategy, Test, Winning.
 Consisteny
The essential property of a formalism, aording to Hilbert. The ompleteness theorem shows
that any onsistent lassial theory has a model and onsisteny is therefore a way to prove
the existene of innite objets without ommitting one to dubious set-theoreti onstru-
tions... At least this was Hilbert's original motivation. Unfortunately there is almost no
example of a proof of existene oming from onsisteny : in real life onsisteny is obtained
from the model, not the other way around. The ommonsense limitation of onsisteny is
that most possible worlds are of no interest, in other terms onsisteny is presumably not
the ultimate internal property.
The limitations of onsisteny beome obvious as soon as we step out of lassial logi. Typ-
ially intuitionisti logi guarantees that there is an (impliit) ontents in a proof, typially
a proof of a disjuntion A _ B an be transformed into either a proof of A or a proof of
B. But what about the intuitionisti system in whih we have added the axiom shema
A_ :A ? This intuitionisti system (whih is idential to lassial logi) should be delared
A inonsistent B sine it asserts nonsense, properties that it annot justify. . . but unfortu-
nately no formal ontradition an be found. However we an observe that something an
be said : as an intuitionisti system, lassial logi has no ut-elimination, i.e., there is no
way to prove A _ :A in a ut-free system using intuitionisti sequents. This suggests that
ut-elimination whih is, by the way, well-known to enfore onsisteny is muh more
entral than onsisteny.
Not be unjust with Hilbert, we should admit that he was seeking a sort of immanene out of
formal onsiderations on proofs. And surely onsisteny is one of the desirable properties of
a logial system, but a rather obsure one, like the existene of brakes is one of the desirable
properties of a ar, by no way the entral one whih is perhaps that the engine works.
Consisteny eventually looks like the A poor man's immanene B.

juntion property, Fundamentalism, Jurassi Park, Obstination, Syntax, Truth.
 Consisteny proof
The seond inompleteness theorem forbids the existene of any onvining onsisteny
proof. However the desire for suh results was so great that logiians, espeially in Germany,
kept on seeking onsisteny proofs ; after all ertain sets make money by selling insuranes
against the explosion of Earth. . . All this eventually ended with the onstrution of larger
and larger Ordinalzahlen, with very few outputs, but ideologial. An exeption is to be made
with Gentzen who produed atual ideas, like sequent alulus (Gentzen, 1969a), and ordinal
analysis (Gentzen, 1969b).

 Construtivism
An ideologial ombination of (the drawbaks of) Hilbert and Brouwer : you want eetive
results, but you also want your methods to be pure. But nobody agrees on purity : onstru-
tivists split as easily as Trotskyists.
See : Brouwer, Construtivity, Creative subjet, Intuitionisti logi, Saaty volume.
 Construtivity
Not the same as onstrutivism, no setarism is involved : A The olour of the at does not
matter provided she athes mie B. Construtivity deals with the how, whereas onstru-
tivism is tied to the why.
Kreisel was rst to give an expliit ontents to mathematial proofs, think of his analy-
sis (Kreisel, 1958) of a famous theorem of Littlewood : this theorem states that the dier-
ene between (x) (the number of prime numbers less than x) and its integral approximation
known as Li(x), osillates, i.e., that the sign hanges innitely often. The proof was made
in two parts, depending on the truth or falsity of the Riemann hypothesis, whih made it
non-eetive ; following the spirit of ut-elimination, Kreisel was able so to speak to
eliminate uts between the two parts, and eventually got a bound on the rst hange of sign
of (x)   Li(x).

itionisti logi banishes ontration to the right under the pretext that only one formula is
allowed.
Weakening (the other dubious strutural priniple) is admitted in ludis, with the proviso
that it is onsidered as losing dog's play. Contration is not allowed at all, for geomet-
rial reasons : one ould not make sense of normalisation and/or separation would fail.
In linear logi, ontration makes its way through the exponentials. The exponentials look
like a formal way to make linear what is quadrati or worse, think of a Fok spae. But this is
nothing but a way to harbour non-linear features inside a linear framework. To understand
the distintion : if F?A for all A 2 E then F?A for all A 2 E
??
, but if F?'(A)
  (A) for
all A 2 E, there is no way to onlude that F?'(A)
  (A) for all A 2 E
??
. So to speak,
the set F
?
is a hyperplane, whereas f'(A)
  (A);A 2Eg is a quadrati variety whih an
by no means be desribed as intersetion of hyperplanes.

 Control
In logi programming, a typial antiphrasis : so-alled A ontrol instrutions B are supposed
to improve the searh algorithm, by taking liberties w.r.t. logial orthodoxy. The result is a
omplete loss of ontrol. . .

 Convergene
The good property of normalisation : (normal) termination. Convergene expresses the on-
sensus between the players, i.e., the orthogonality of their respetive designs. In innitary
logis, onvergene is proven by means of ordinal assignments.
See : Consensus, Dissensus, Normalisation, Ordinal analysis, Orthogonality.
 Copyat
Sine I am autious, I play on two boards, White against Karpov, Blak against Kasparov
(the Chess player). I am negative, i.e., the other amp starts. When one of the two K. has
played a move, say a2-a3, this is exatly my answer to the other K. If any Chess play had
a winner, I would be sure to win on one of my boards.
In ludis the opyat beomes the Fax, to stress the fat that the two boards are not the
same. The opyat is the paragon of the good logial joke, whih onveys a large part of the
intuition of what is an identity axiom. . . one does not need to know Chess to be a suessful
opyat. What is missing in the metaphor is deloation, but think a seond : the natural
way to do it is the Web (in simultaneous plays in a single room, you are likely to be aught).

 Cordwainer Smith
What a surprise to disover that several distinguished logiians share my admiration for the
siene-tion writer Cordwainer Smith ! This guy wrote about intelligene, destiny. . . in a
surprising way : for instane his robots have some animal part, just to make mistakes, whih
he understands as an essential part of intelligene. . . With Smith, we are far astray from
the AI ideology and the identiation A intelligent = formal B.

 Corretness riterion
Assume that we have a proof-struture , i.e., a would-be proof of a single formula A,
without ut, and that we are given a swithing S of , then we an produe a A proof B
of ` A
?
. As usual, we start with the onlusion, until we reah axioms. The formulas
ourring in the sequents of our paraproof will be the negations of the formulas of . The
(non-deterministi) algorithm is as follows (sequents are onsidered up to order, i.e., modulo
exhange) :
1 If I get a sequent `  ; B P C, and if B
?
; C
?
our in , then I an apply a P-rule, with
the sequent `  ; B; C as premise.
2 If I get a sequent `  ; B 
 C, and if B
?
; C
?
our in  as the premises of a P-link L,
then I an apply a 
-rule whose premises are
F `  ; B and ` C if S(L) = l
F ` B and `  ; C if S(L) = r
3 Otherwise `   is aepted as an axiom (paralogism A Give up B)
Suh a A paraproof B an be represented as a proof-struture, whih is exatly as usual,
but for the fat that arbitrary axioms (i.e., links with no premises with the formulas of   as
onlusions) are used to represent the axiom `   ; exept for this detail, this proof-struture
is in fat a proof-net, whih is uniquely determined by S. Now, observe that
1 Cut-elimination still holds.
2 Paralogisms produe A enough B paraproofs.
LOCUS SOLUM 105
As to (1), I an perform a ut between my proof-net of A and my paraproof-net of A
?
and
perform ut-elimination in this paraproof-net, up to the moment where all 
 and P-links
have been eliminated. Geometrially I end with a onneted and ayli struture, ontain-
ing only axioms and uts. This orresponds to the neessity of the riterion. As to (2), if I
onsider those paraproof-nets oming from swithings, then the suieny of the riterion
enables me to sequentialise my proof-net. The swithings should be atually seen as a dense
subset of paraproofs.
The homogeneity between proofs and paraproofs is total, provided we add this A Give up B
to logi : slightly modied it beomes the Daimon of ludis.

 Curry-Howard
The isomorphism between simply typed -alulus and natural dedution is a typial prod-
ut of the late sixties, summarised by Howard's paper (Howard, 1980) widely irulated,
but published muh later. It must be notied that the idea of proofs-as-funtions was in the
air anyway, and that the isomorphism (not a vague mutual enoding with leakage in both
diretions) is the entral transition between the age of odings and the age of ategories.
Linear logi later proposed proof-as-proesses.
Jean-Yves Girard 106
Curry-Howard is the rst non-realist approah to logi written in deent terms, for realis-
ability and its abuse of oding was pushing too muh in the diretion of subjetivism, whih
is not a good alternative.

 Cut-elimination
The main ahievement of Gentzen, (Gentzen, 1969a). Sequent alulus is not made of formu-
las, but of sequents   ` , where  ; are nite sequenes of formulas and the new symbol
A ` B is not quite impliation. The usual Modus Ponens, i.e., A From A and A) B dedue
B B is replaed with

(201)
the ut-rule, the rule that you love to hate. Observe that the alulus of Gentzen distinguishes
the rule Modus Ponens from the impliation (A ^ (A) B))) B. The ut-elimination the-
orem, whih basially yields an algorithm to eliminate ut is surprising, sine it relates two
absolutely opposite views of logi. The dedutive, or impliit approah is about lemmas 
whih ontain the main ideas that one ombines together like modules in programming : a
real proof basially uses the ut rule. The expliit approah is without ut, and in pratie is
never used, but by omputers, sine all ideas i.e., lemmas have disappeared. But a om-
puter an idiot with big brains an use ut-elimination, either to transform an impliit
proof into an expliit one, or simply to look for a ut-free proof, sine the absene of ut re-
strits proof-searh to subformulas. Cut-elimination is a ompleteness theorem (the real one
indeed !), saying that the expliit approah is a strong as the impliit one. The distintion
between expliit and impliit is well explained by this omputer analogy : expliit booleans
are Yes or No, but impliit booleans are more interesting, they are of the form Algorithm
+ Argument, i.e., of a ut. The impliit boolean is a question, the expliit boolean is the
answer

 Cut-net
Several designs together, whose bases form a onneted-ayli graph. A ut-net is bound
to be normalised. A ut is just a oinidene handle/tine between the bases of two designs.
Here we stumble on an important point, already known sine the paper (Girard, 1989a) on
Geometry of Interation : in the identity axiom A ` A, the two A are distint, so that it is
not a true identity axiom (or identity fax ; by the way how ould we think of a fax as the
identity, if the fax of real life were the identity, I would not have one at home !), but in the
ut rule

When I say that we are not interested in answers, just remark that the words A yes, no B have stritly
no interest, to be more preise, these are presumably the only booleans with no meaning at all : they are
ut-free, i.e., pure answers, but answers to nothing.
LOCUS SOLUM 107
the two A are atually the same, i.e., share the same loation.
To understand this point, ommonsense is enough : GoI onsiders the axiom as an extension
ord (distant) whereas ut orresponds to plugging : in order to plug you must oinide,
a distant plugging would mean a hidden ord, i.e., a hidden identity link. The two A of
the ut therefore have a ommon loation, and they must be of opposite polarity ; only a
oinidene handle/tine between the respetive bases  ` ;  and  `  of two designs
mathes the idea that the information (positive) ontained in  ` ;  will be transmitted
to  `  through the  : information exits through tines and enters through handles. During
ut-elimination, the original ut endeavours many transformations, in other terms one ut
beome n uts and two designs beome n+1 designs, this is why we must desribe a general
situation with a nite number of uts, ut-nets.
See : Churh-Rosser, Composition of strategies, Design, Fax, Geometry of interation,
Lous, Pithfork.
 Cut-rule
The rule whih expresses the transitivity of impliation in sequent alulus, in fat the only
really dedutive rule of logi. Cut is the possibility to use and reuse lemmas. Cut-elimination
is therefore a sort of mirale. It relates the impliit and the expliit through ut-elimination.
The disussion in (Girard, 1989b) is slightly anient, but is still valuable.
See : Composition of strategies, Cut-elimination, Cut-net, Expliit, Impliit, Lemma,
Lewis Carroll, Sequent alulus.
 Daimon
A ! has all possible powers, inluding that of reating an axiom, when needed. In
terms of proof-searh the daimon an be seen as giving up, the same in terms of games : in
that ase you just lose.
In terms of designs, the Daimon is the exat dual of the Skunk. The Daimon normalises
against every design, whereas the Skunk normalises against no design, but the Daimon, who
is denitely very brave. The Daimon has an optimal soialisation, whereas the Skunk lives
alone : the only behaviour ontaining the Skunk is>, whih is made of all negative designs ;
but these designs are so to speak not really here, sine they have an empty inarnation.
The daimon is a novel objet. However, its reation must be asribed to the paper (Girard,
1988), whih is the rst attempt at a purely internal explanation of logi, formulated in
terms of permutations

 Deloation
In real life, a way to avoid interferene. For instane a traditional bandit will rob everybody
but his mother ; if you deloate him, you get a more uniform behaviour. . . In the same way
when Superman hits a able ar, one takes him away from the lous of the. . . aident, so
as to get. . . an objetive trial.
In mathematis, interferene orresponds to apture of bound variables, or the fat that
two strutures do interset ; deloation renames variables, replaes sum with disjoint union,
et. In ludis deloation avoids logial interferene, i.e., the sharing of any lous distint

And whih an be easily rephrased as a full ompleteness theorem for multipliative linear logi.

from the base. Typially G will after deloation only use even biases, whereas H will
use odd ones. Deloated behaviours interat spiritually, i.e., on the basis of their properties,
independently of the loations.
Usual logial operations appear as the ombination of a deloation with a strit opera-
tion ; what is important is that this strit operation is. . . stritly assoiative, ommutative,
et., i.e., the loative variant is not a poor relative. Deloation enables one to desribe the
properties of GH from the properties of G;H : this is the essential soure of logial om-
pleteness. Inompleteness essentially ours with (seond-order) quantiation, whih is the
only operation that is intrinsially loative, for want of enough loi . . .

 Denotational semantis
Originated by Sott (Sott, 1976) and Ershov in the late sixties (Sott domains), improved
by Berry (Berry, 1978) in the seventies (stability), leading to oherent spaes (Girard, 1987a),
hyperoherenes (Ehrhard, 1995)et., denotational semantis is an important area, essential
in the disovery of linear logi, ludis. Denotational semantis is a partiular ase of ate-
gorial semantis, with a onrete twist.
The opposition denotational/operational semantis is unfair to denotational semantis.
See : Categorial semantis, Coherent spae, Dualiser, Hyperoherene, Impliit, Op-
erational semantis, Sott domain, Stability.
 Design
Designs play the role usually devoted to proofs, -terms et. in usual syntax, and funtions,
liques et. in denotational semantis. But this is only an analogy.
Designs are not linked to any partiular syntax. They are essentially inspired from linear
logi, espeially the multipliative/additive fragment, with the idea that this fragment is in
some vague sense universal. Other inspirations were taken from pure -alulus (espeially
B√∂hm trees) and innitary (non-well founded) logi.
Designs are not syntax at all. First they use no logial symbols, only loations ; of ourse, it
is possible to enode syntax in loations, but impossible to impose those restritions typial
of syntax : there is no roupier that an forbid us say to play number 37. Seond they
are badly innite, both in width and depth : the typial example of a design is the fax who
has full innite negative branhings and whih is badly not well-founded. Last but not least,
designs are not even supposed to be reursive.
They are not semantis either, although they are issued from the tradition of semantis
of proofs whih started with Kolmogorov, and embody later developments suh as Sott
domains or oherent spaes. Designs an even look like lassial models, but their struture
is muh subtler than any of the usual semantial artifats.

properties, Phase semantis, Proofs vs. models, Separation, Slie, Semantis, Strategy,

 Dessein
In Frenh A dessein B means A projet, plot B, like in the sentene A Le savant fou ruminait de
noirs desseins. B. The design-as-dessein is the real notion, and is dened as a set of hroniles.
Desseins is the streamlike version of designs. Typially, the pithforks ourring in a dessin
LOCUS SOLUM 109
annot be gured out, sine they are A in the proess of being built B.
See : Ation, Chronile, Design, Dessin, Non-determinism, Propagation, Separation,
Stream, View.
 Dessin
In Frenh A dessin B means A drawing, piture B. Designs-as-dessins are onvenient presenta-
tions of desseins, in a proof-style reminisent of innitary logis : a dessin looks like a proof
in sequent alulus, in whih sequents have been replaed with pithforks. But they are not
the real objet, they are a reiation, i.e., they represent something like the eventual version
of a streamlike underlying objet. In pratie the distintion dessein/dessin is not that big ;
everything an be done with dessins, provided we stay streamlike.
See : Ation, Design, Dessein, Pithfork, Propagation, Reiation, Separation, Stream.
 Dialetia interpretation
Published only in 1958 in the philosophial journal Dialetia, and apparently muh older,
this is G√∂del's ontribution to an interative, dialeti, interpretation. What to say about it,
without being unfair ? It is not G√∂del's best work, but it stands miles above the bureaurati
failure of the Lorenzen shool.
Roughly speaking the interpretation looks as 9x8yA, where A is quantier-free. x an be
seen as a strategy, winning against any ounter-strategy y the game A. The idea is not
bad, but the formulation indues a dissymmetry between Proponent and Opponent, and
the interpretation of logial onnetives beomes a nightmare think of the impliation
beause of this bias. The interpretation works, but it denitely leaks. The attempt by De
Paiva (Paiva, 1989) at a simpliation of Dialetia by means of linear logi was interesting,
but not suient to give a seond breath to this original work.
Sine this is a work of G√∂del, every textbook on proof-theory has an ompulsory hapter on
the unfortunate Dialetia. . . usually written with the left hand.
See : Leakage, Game, Game semantis, Lorenzen, System F.
 Dialetis
Illustrated by Hegel, Marx, not to speak of omrade Stalin. . . , this is a word with a history.
For this reason, even if ludis has a lot to do with (the early) dialetis, I deided to reate
a new expression rather than having to assume the (mostly negative) onsequenes of the
reuse of suh a notorious word. By the way this proximity of ludis with dialetis that it
would be unfair to negate is not the result of say an attempt in the style of Engels's
Dialektik der Natur, but only the result of a long familiarity with logi, the ontemplation
of the symmetries of proof-theory.

 Diretory
A diretory is a set of ramiations. A negative rule involves a diretory, whih an therefore

 Disjuntion property
Commutation of provability with disjuntion : unproperly stated as A a proof of A _ B is
either a proof of A or a proof of B B : ommonsense tells you that if you have proven B you
will not state A_B. The property should rather be stated as A a proof of A_B is impliitly
either a proof of A or a proof of B B, whih means that the proof an be seen as program
whose exeution will eventually yield either a proof of A or a proof of B. In intuitionisti
logi the disjuntion property is implemented by means of ut-elimination, sine a ut-free
proof of A_B omes atually from a proof of A or a proof of B. The linear additive disjun-
tion whih is the disjuntive part of intuitionisti disjuntion also enjoys the disjuntion
property.
In ludis, the disjuntion property is just ompleteness of the additive disjuntion, written
as GH = G [H.
See : Brouwer, Completeness (internal), Consisteny, Existene property, Expliit, Im-
pliit, Prenex form.
 Dispute
There is in fat a third layer below behaviours and designs, namely disputes, whih are so to
speak the plays (remember that designs are strategies and behaviours are games). A dispute
is a sequene of ations ending with a daimon, not quite the same as a hronile. Designs an
be represnted as sets of disputes enjoying ertain properties, so that the form  D j E
onverges exatly when D;E interset. Disputes are an important element of ludis, but I
found it so diult to start with them that I eventually deided to ignore them, and to start
with designs.
The theory of disputes, whih will make expliit the relation with denotational semantis,
e.g., designs-as-liques, is still to be written.
See : Behaviour, Coherent spae, Design, Denotational semantis, Game semantis.

K diverges, and this dissensus is a way to get rid of the atomi
weapon.
The possibility of dissensus makes the tests testable in turn, ontrarily to the naive approah
loosely inspired from Popper, for whom the tests are absolute. Remember that Pauperism
denies any meaning to a non-falsiable formula, for instane to G√∂del's theorem. In ludis,
G√∂del's theorem ould be refuted, the problem is that the refuting test ould in turn be
reused.
See : Atomi weapon, Behaviour, Consensus, Game semantis, Obstination, Pauperism,
Referee, Unfalsiable.
 Distributivity
The distributivity of the multipliatives over additives is due to the existene of two adjun-
tions, and the possibility of expressing G PH either as (1) the set of designs whih send
G
?
into H or (2) the set of designs whih send H
?
into G. If you want distributivity to the
right you use (1), whereas distributivity to the left requires (2).
Distributivity is part of the general A assoiativity B properties of onnetives of the same
LOCUS SOLUM 111
polarity. As soon as one does not respet polarities, distributivity fails, typially 
 does not
distribute over & : assuming that enough shifts have been added so as to avoid mismathes
of polarities, we see that G
 (H&K) an be implemented by one deloated opy of eah
of G;H;K, whereas there is no way to implement (G
H) & (G
K) with only one delo-
ation of G ; this reason for the non-distribution of the two onjuntions seems to me more
onvining than the usual semanti explanations. Observe that the distribution fails beause
the onnetive & is spiritual, hene must be deloated,. . . but the argument no longer ap-
plies for quantiers, and this is why 
 distributes over any intersetion (even beyond the
basi meaning of distributivity, one would not expet 8d(G

H).
See : Adjuntion, Assoiativity, Deloation, Prenex form, Quantier.
 Divergene
Corresponds to failure of normalisation of a ut-net. The output of a diverging net is formally
written as the Faith, whih is the paragon of divergene, just as the Daimon is the paragon
of onvergene.
See : Consensus, Daimon, Dissensus, Faith, Normalisation.
 Dog
The Dog is the guy who is not interested in salads, but thinks you should not eat them. In
usual games, doggish play is something against the spirit of the game that you do not to
win, but to get a draw, see the literature on Chess for instane.
The winning onditions of ludis (parsimony, obstination, uniformity) are not general prop-
erties of designs ; there is a reason for that : non-parsimonious designs, non-obstinate de-
signs are very useful. Typially the ompleteness of tensor strongly relies on the existene
of non-parsimonious designs, orresponding to weakening, i.e., the existene of a reasonable
projetion. However these designs break some impliit ommitment, for instane parsimony
ommits me to fous on eah lous generated by my opponent, uniformity is a stronger form
of oherene. This is why losing designs are eventually red when they have done their job,
like an ordinary independent proseutor.

 Do-it-yourself
Amateurs produe a lot of A logis B, diult to tell from the various A PhD logis B produed
in the area of so-alled A Artial Intelligene B. One an distinguish between Brooli logis
whih are dedutive, i.e., whih admit a (poor) formal system, and paralogis that are not
even dedutive. One of the best examples is this ut-free system in whih everything is
provable but the empty sequent, they all it paraonsistent . . . and they are very serious
about it.
See : Artiial intelligene, Brooli logis, Non-monotoni logis, Paralogis, Tartue.
 Double negation
Yet another ahievement of G√∂del : one an faithfully translate lassial logi into intuition-
isti logi by adding enough double negations. The reason is very simple, namely that the
left part of an intuitionisti sequent is very permissive, whereas the right part is A politially
orret B, everything being forbidden. . . On the other hand the restritions on the right part
(one formula) yield disjuntion and existene properties. When a formula annot soialise
enough on the right, a solution is to transfer it to the left using negation, then perform
whatever lassial operations one wants typially ontrations, before transferring it
Jean-Yves Girard 112
again to the right. . . But the notorious prex A :: B betrays its esapade to the other side
of the wall.
Aross the Curry-Howard isomorphism, the double negation orresponds to transforming a
lambda-term into ontinuation-passing style, see e.g., (Hatli and Danvy, 1994).
See : Classial logi, Contration, Intuitionisti logi, Linear negation, Self-interpreter,
Sequent alulus.
 Dualiser
The dualiser is the behaviour 0 of base ` (the only available hoie). So omes a strange
question : how is this possible without aepting the priniple ? = 0, whih is one possible
formulation of weakening ? If ludis were a ategorial semantis, then we would be stuk. . .
First observe that the fat that the base is empty is essential : the smallest behaviour 0

of
base `  annot be seen as a dualiser (hint : this ontradits parsimony). Moreover,? is a
negative behaviour and annot be the dualiser, sine G √Ü? only makes sense when G is
positive.

Linear negation, Parsimony, Weakening.
 Dualism
A philosophial approah haraterised by a shizophrenia between matter and ideas think
of Desartes. The pregnany of dualism is responsible for familiar oppositions : matter vs.
spirit, objets vs. properties, ontents vs. form, and of ourse semantis vs. syntax. These
oppositions are useful, whih does not mean that they have any oneptual signiane.

Realism, Shizophrenia.
 Dupond et Dupont
The fake twins of Herg√© adepts of La Palie : A C'est mon opinion et je la partage B are
lost with their Jeep in the desert, see (Herg√©, 1950) pp. 29  30, up to the moment they nd
a trak to follow ; they indeed follow their own path whih seems more and more A rowded B
as they make additional loops. A perfet metaphor of Tarskism, Paraphrases and Jurassi
foundations.
See : Jurassi Park, La Palie, Meta, Metaphor, M√ºnhhausen, Paraphrases, Self-
interpreter, Tarskian semantis.
 Empty sequent
Some traditionalists have been shoked to see that ludis is essentially based on the losure
priniple, i.e., normalisation of A proofs B of the empty sequent. But they forget that all
traditional proof-theory is about the study of proofs of the empty sequent, with the idea
that there is no suh proof. All this work about non-existing objets, what a waste. . . Ludis
had the generous idea to provide proof-theory with a large stok of A proofs B of the empty
sequent, so that our fundamentalists feel no longer frustrated and ontemplate abundant
examples of their favourite objet.
See : Dualiser, Fundamentalism, Jurassi Park, Ludis.
 -expansion
In terms of ategories, -expansion orresponds to the uniity of the solution of the universal
problem dening suh and suh onnetive. This an be translated as the deomposition of
the general identity axiom A ` A of sequent alulus into its atomi instanes X ` X ; this
LOCUS SOLUM 113
proess has perfet analogues in natural dedution, -alulus, proof-nets. . . Now the synta-
tial distintion between atomi and non-atomi axioms annot be interatively observed :
for instane, B√∂hm's theorem separates solvable terms up to -expansion. The separation
theorem of ludis also orresponds to the hoie of -expansion : in fat we expand A so
muh B that the identity axiom never shows up !
See : Atomi proposition, B√∂hm tree, Fax, Identity axiom, -alulus, Natural dedu-
tion, Proof-nets, Separation, Sequent alulus.
 Ethis
Corresponds to the idea of those proofs of a given formula that ome from the syntax : an
ethis is a set of designs E of a given basis, whih generates a behaviour E
??
. An ethis is
omplete when E
??
= E (up to inarnation).
See : Behaviour, Biethis, Completeness (internal), G√∂del's inompleteness, Inom-
pleteness.
 Exatness
A design is exat when it an be written without waste of ontexts, so to speak without
weakening. A weaker but interative version of the same is parsimony. Full ompleteness
forMALL
2
is established under the assumption of exatness, not of parsimony. The leakage
between exat and parsimonious should indue new developments.
See : Full ompleteness, Inarnation, Leakage, Parsimony, Weakening, Xenoglossy.
 Existene property
Commutation of provability with existene : A A proof of 9nA[n‚ÑÑ is impliitly a proof of A[n‚ÑÑ
for a ertain integer n B ; this is similar to the disjuntion property. 9nA[n‚ÑÑ therefore means
that we have a program enabling us to extrat a witness n suh that A[n‚ÑÑ from the proof of
existene.
Ludis refutes the existene property for general quantiers : the intuitionisti formula
(8dA
d
) ) B an be identied with 9d(A
d
) B), this is an instane of the general prenex
form priniple of ludis. This does not apply to numerial quantiers, sine 9nA is in fat
short for 9d (d 2 N ^ A) ; the existene property for natural numbers will be valid in ludis.
See : Brouwer, Disjuntion property, Expliit, Impliit, Prenex form, Quantier.

. The typial expansive
property is provability, or halting. The Daimon z is the abstrat form of expansivity.
See : Daimon, Falsiable, Pauperism, Reessive,  and  formulas, Stream.
 Expliit
Something expliit has no value in itself : what do you think of A yes B ? Of ourse this word
is more interesting when not said by a yes man, but orresponds to a question. The question
orresponds to the impliit, the answer to the expliit, and they are linked by expliitation.

Expliitation, Frege, Impliit, Proofs as programs, Question.
 Expliit mathematis
A perfet oxymoron : reasoning is preisely about the impliit. Mathematis is neither ex-
pliit nor formal, but it should be expliitable and formalisable.
See : Abstration, Formal, Formalisable, Expliitation, Frege, Impliit, Oxymoron.
Jean-Yves Girard 114
 Expliitation
The art of extrating the impliit ontents. Corresponds to normalisation, ut-elimination
in logi ; in omputer siene to the exeution of a program.
See : Computer siene, Construtivity, Cut-elimination, Expliit, Expliit mathemat-
is, Impliit, Normalisation, Proofs as programs.
 Exponentials
These onnetives have been introdued to keep a reasonable amount of lassiism inside
linear logi : linear logi is issued from the denotational equation
A) B = !A √ÜB (204)
!A is traditionally interpreted as A A ad libitum B, i.e., as the absene of any resoure bound
(see the gastronomi menu). They are therefore loser to the traditional aeptation of logi,
whih deals with eternal truths, and they an be desribed as the non-linear part of linear
logi.
It took me a very long time (at least two years, 1997  99) to understand the atual deom-
position of exponentials, the main diulty being to adapt the seemingly universal polarity
priniple to that ase :
F !G is dened for negative G and is positive.
F !G an be deomposed as #‚ÑÑG, where #is the usual shift (hange of polarity) and ‚ÑÑG is
a negative behaviour, the atual exponential.
?G is dually written as "[G, where [ is a onnetive mapping positive behaviours to positive
behaviours.
See : Classial logi, Contration, Gastronomi menu, Linear logi, Polarity, Xenoglossy.
 Faith
The only denitely partial design, the exat opposite of the daimon, and the paragon of
reessivity, i.e. of divergene. The relation
Fid  D  Dai (205)
expresses that all real dessins are in between Faith and Daimon. The daimon provides us
with an immediate negative answer : the daimon is a total easy-going design. Faith would
also provide us with the same negative answer (i.e., that the design does not start with a
proper rule), if we were patient, but we have the faith. . . Jesus said, just before taking o
A I am oming bak. B, and some people are still waiting.
When a proess is stalled on the omputer, either we wait (Faith) or we use C- (Daimon).
In both ases we don't get what we are after, but we have some ompensations, the hope
that it will eventually ome, or the possibility to try something else. The same dilemma 
=z
ours in most ativities, e.g., when waiting for a bus in Roma. Paralogis are usually based
on something like the identiation between 
 and z and you an gure out the disaster.

 Falsifiable
The neo-positivist philosopher Popper introdued this terminology to speak of what should
be a real sienti statement : a property, that you an verify up to an arbitrary degree of
preision : A for any preision N the property holds up to size N B, and suh a sentene is
LOCUS SOLUM 115
true as long as we have no ounterexample, i.e., no falsiation. These formulas are familiar
to the logiian, and alled 

in ludis) ; the emphasis on suh properties is indeed
Hilbert's redo expressed in (Hilbert, 1926).
I prefer to use the word A reessive B for this style of properties, sine the more you hek,
the less you get. Observe that provability like all streamlike ativities is not reessive,
the more you hek, the more you get. The mismath between expansive and reessive,
expressed by the inompleteness theorem or the undeidability of the halting problem shows
the limitation of Pauperism the nikname I give to this abusive extension to mathematis
of Popper's paradigm.
The emphasis on falsiability an be understood from the na√Øve A physiian ideology B for
whih siene looks like a ook book : a law is something that has not been onretely
disproved yet.

 Fax
The most general form of a fax is a design of base  ` 
0
implementing a deloation between
 and 
0
. The fax orresponds to the identity axiom of logi, and in terms of strategies, it
works like the opyat strategy whih onsists in systematially reopying the A move B of
the other.
The base is negative, i.e., Opponent starts. The rst negative rule has a premise of index
I for any ramiation I , orresponding to any possible move of the Opponent. Above I ,
Proponent answers with a similar move (the same I , but on 
0
), and we are left with a simi-
lar problem, but with the 
0
i ` i instead. The same struture is repeated ad nauseam, in
partiular the fax is very badly not well-founded. The fax is the paragon of the barbihette :
he systematially reopies, hene he annot make the mistakes rst !
See : Atomi proposition, Barbihette, Copyat, Cut-net, Deloation, -expansion,
Identity axiom, Ourrene, Twins.
 Fermat
Fermat's last theorem is the paragon of the falsiable (or reessive) property : something
holds for all natural numbers n. In spite of the proof of Wiles, it might still be possible to
falsify this result, namely by nding ad ho natural numbers suh that a
n
+ b
n
= 
n
; in this
unlikely situation, we would onlude that Fermat's last theorem is wrong, and also that
mathematis is inonsistent. The situation is quite dierent with G√∂del's theorem.
See : Answer, Falsiable, Inonsisteny proof, Question, Reessive, Unfalsiable.
 First-order quantifier
A universal rst-order quantier is usually understood as a &, possibly uniform. Ludis
interprets rst-order quantiation by a plain intersetion, so that rst-order quantiation
gets the qualities (prenex forms) and the drawbaks (inompleteness, e.g., prenex forms) of
the seond-order ase. I denitely prefer those simple and inomplete rst order quantiers
to those of the tradition. But the real question is not preferene, it is use, and there are
learly uses for a omplete rst-order existential.
Observe that the onstrutive tradition (e.g., denotational semantis) has been extremely
unimaginative as to this issue : as far as I know, people have only been able to interpret
8 as a sort of innitary onjuntion, &
d2D
, whih is inomplete too, sine it inherits all
Jean-Yves Girard 116
drawbaks of innitary logis, without any interesting property suh as prenex forms. The
solution presumably lies in a use of uniformity : replae & by a A symmetri B variant in
the spirit of what we did in hapter 7 for the symmetri sum.
By the way observe that we annot interpret seond-order quantiation as a &, for we
annot deloate : there are muh more behaviours than loi !
See : Bihaviour, Deloation, Harmony, Innitary logis, Prenex form, Quantier, Uni-
formity.
 Fixed point
The streamlike, expansive nature of objets, makes it possible to get various xed-point
theorems, e.g., in -alulus. But this badly fails for properties.
See : -alulus, Objets and properties, Reursive type.
 Foalisation
This property, due to Andreoli, (Andreoli and Pareshi, 1991), is dual to invertibility. It
says that provided one does it at the right time, one an onsider a luster of posi-
tive onnetives as a syntheti onnetive, and perform the relevant rules simultaneously.
Connetives of the same polarity therefore assoiate, whih depending on the situation may
mean ommutativity, assoiativity, neutrality, distributivity. . . It turns out that the graphi-
al style P;?;&;> versus 
; 1;; 0 learly tells the negatives from the positive. . . but this
graphism was found long before the disovery of Andreoli. The idea behind the graphism
was to memorise the remarkable isomorphisms (e.g., the distribution 
=), but foalisation
shows that these isomorphisms are atually due to the identity of polarities : this explaining
that. The dual properties of invertibility/foalisation express the assoiativity of logi.
See : Assoiativity, Fous, Invertibility, Lous, Polarity, Sequentiality, Stoup, Syntheti
onnetive, Time in logi.
 Fous
The formula on whih a foalisation is performed. In ludis, the lous of an ation.
See : Ation, Foalisation, Lous.
 Forgetful interpretation
The forgetful interpretation of system F onsists in removing all type deorations in terms,
so as to get a pure -term. The orret interpretation is that this underlying -term is the
real objet, whereas the typings are omments, to be ignored at runtime. We do the same
to a more systemati extent in ludis by forgetting everything but the loations.
See : -alulus, Lous, PER-model, System F.
 Formal
Hilbert treated mathematis as a formal ativity, whih is a nonsense, if we take it literally. . .
But what to think of those who take thought as a formal ativity ?
See : Abdution, Artiial intelligene, Bureauray, Cordwainer Smith, Expliit math-
ematis, Formalisable, Laplae, Sense of rules.
 Formalisable
Mathematis is formalisable. Theorem provers don't and annotwork, but proof-hekers
are very eient. For instane my rst theorem, normalisation for system F (Girard, 1971),
has been formally heked by a omputer (Altenkirh, 1993) : the work was begun by Berardi
and nished by Altenkirh.

 Form vs. ontents
A shizophrenia typial of dualism, of no oneptual value. Most of the story of modern
proof-theory up to ludis was preisely to extrat the atual ontents from the form.
See : Categorial semantis, Dualism, Ludis, Shizophrenia.
 Formula
One of the main syntatial artifats. In ludis, formulas beome behaviours, or bihaviours.
The notion of behaviour being syntax-free, it is linked to no partiular bureaurati system.
See : Behaviour, Bihaviour, Bureauray.
 Foundations
There is a want for foundational studies. However, G√∂del's theorem forbids any redutionist
foundation fundamentalism. What remains is the possibility of dislosing deeper stru-
tures I believe that ludis is part of this proess.
See : Consisteny proof, Fundamentalism, How and why, Jurassi Park, Ludis.
 Frankenstein
Pr. Dr. Frankenstein reated a monster out of a wrong analysis. In the same way, the hasty
analysis of Lorenzen and al. (Lorenzen, 1960), (Lorenz, 1968), (Felsher, 1985), ould only
lead to a monstrous synthesis.

 Full ompleteness
The terminology is due to Abramsky, although the idea was rst formulated in my paper
(Girard, 1991). Abramsky tried also to onvey the fullness of the funtor (Abramsky and
Jagadeesan, 1994) that interprets proofs : A With full ompleteness, one has the tightest
possible onnetion between syntax and semantis. We are not aware of any previous pub-
lished results of this type: however, the idea is related to representation theorems in ategory
theory (Freyd and Sedrov, 1990), to full abstration theorems in programming language se-
mantis (Milner, 1975), (Plotkin, 1977), to studies of parametri polymorphism (Bainbridge
et al., 1990) , (Hyland et al., 1989) , and to the ompleteness onjeture in (Girard, 1991). B
The hallenge was to prove full ompleteness for linear logi. This has proved to be a very
good question, for whih I rst gave an (unsatisfatory) answer in (Girard, 1999a) (unsat-
isfatory beause of the pregnany of the referee, disguised as a Par-monoid, for the uent
reader). In hapter 10 we establish the result in the absene of exponentials, under a slightly
stronger hypothesis, exatness.

 Fundamentalism
The urrent redutionist aeptation of foundations : in spite of G√∂del's theorem, it should
be possible to found mathematis on something simpler. A personal reolletion (1972) :
replied Sh√ºtte when I said that aording to Kreisel, a onsisteny proof of set-theory
would have no value at all : A Maybe, but I would feel better if I saw one ! B.

Jean-Yves Girard 118
 Game
Gentzen's rst onsisteny proof (1936) (Gentzen, 1969) is presumably more interesting
than the seond one. In this proof he developed this is explained in a onfusing way an
interative interpretation of arithmeti, whih must be onsidered as the rst interative ex-
planation of logi. G√∂del's Dialetia interpretation (G√∂del, 1958) is also a game semantis.
However the idea must be asribed to Lorenzen, even if the work of his shool is tehnially
of little interest, whih is not the ase of the works of Gentzen and G√∂del.
In between the Lorenzen Shool and reent work, the urious work of Blass (Blass, 1972),
see also (Blass, 1992), inspired from set-theory, stands alone. . . a genuine work, with some
preguration fteen years before of linear logi.

 Game semantis
Contrarily
71
to usual denotational semantis, this approah makes time expliit. Basially
two agents (traditionally alled Proponent and Opponent) onstrut an alternating sequene
of tokens, subjet to ertain rules depending on the type of the game. This sequene an be
understood as the trae of the interation between a program (Proponent) and its environ-
ment (Opponent) (Abramsky and Jagadeesan, 1994; Danos et al., 1996). Three traditions
have merged giving rise to a very exible tool for onstruting semantis of the exeution of
programming languages.
F The proof theoreti tradition, initiated by Gentzen and followed by the Lorenzen shool,
and more reently by Blass (Blass, 1972; Blass, 1992), and Abramsky, Malaaria and
Jagadeesan (Abramsky et al., 2000) interprets a proof of A as a (winning) strategy
allowing a defender of A to answer any attempt to ontradit A.
F The reursivity tradition, initiated by Kleene and Gandy, and reently by the H
2
O-games
of (Hyland and Ong, 2000) and (Nikau, 1994), originated in a desription of higher order
reursive funtionals as strategies in adequate games.
F Finally the denotational tradition goes bak to the work of Berry and Curien (Berry and
Curien, 1982) on sequential algorithms.
A omprehensive survey an be found in (Abramsky and M Cusker, 1999).

Gentzen is responsible for three essential ideas, all of them introdued in the hope of om-
pleting Hilbert's onsisteny program, namely sequent alulus (Gentzen, 1969a), game se-
mantis (Gentzen, 1969) and ordinal analysis (Gentzen, 1969b).

 Geometry of interation
Geometry of interation (GoI) (Girard, 1989a), interprets proofs by means of operators on
the Hilbert spae H, always the same. The tensor produt onsists in forming, from two
operators ;	 on spae H a new operator A sum B whih only depends of the isomorphism
lass of , 	 : the natural one is given by the matrix
 =

 0
0 	

(207)
But  operates on the wrong spae, namely HH, and one makes use of an isomorphism
x  y 7! p(x) + q(y) of H  H in H to get an operator of H, namely pp

+ q	q

. p; q
enjoy the equalities p

p = q

q = 1; p

q = q

p = 0, so that pp

and q	q

are nothing but
A disjoint B isomorphi opies of  and 	.
In ludis, the deloations ';  introdued in 4.2.2 are the exat analogous of the p; q of GoI :
if e
n
is a base of H, we an dene p; q by p(e
n
) = e
3n
, q(e
n
) = e
3n+1
.
Geometry of interation was oneived as an interative approah to logi not quite a game
semantis : this aspet was made expliit in (Abramsky et al., 2000). Let us quote Abramsky
(private ommuniation) as to this onnetion : A The work of myself and Jagadeesan started
with the attempt to fashion a proper ategorial model from game semantis ideas, taking
Blass's work (Blass, 1992), whih did not sueed in doing this, as a starting point. In the
ourse of proving full ompleteness in the paper (Abramsky and Jagadeesan, 1994), I realised
that proof-like strategies were history-free, and history-freeness beame a key ondition in
the model. Then, we realized that a orrespondene ould be made between semantis of
proofs as history-free strategies, and Geometry of Interation - whih I think was a genuine
insight at the time. For example, omposition of strategies is dened in a very dierent
looking way from the Exeution formula, and one has to show they atually orrespond. B
The problem of GoI is that it leaks, in the sense that it annot tell the dierene between
Fid and Dai, both of them being rendered by the operator 0. Of ourse GoI must eventually
be revisited.

 G√∂del

Tarski), the Dialetia interpretation.
See : Completeness (external), Classial model, Dialetia interpretation, G√∂del's in-
ompleteness, Inompleteness, Truth.
 G√∂del's inompleteness
There are two inompleteness theorems :
F The seond inompleteness theorem states the impossibility of xing your spetales while
wearing them. This is ommon sense by the way what would you think of somebody
whose redit would rely on his own delarations ? There is a popular literature on the
topi, trying to point out that after all G√∂del was warped and that the theorem is hardly
more than a puzzle.
F The rst inompleteness theorem, whih is the refutation of Hilbert's program. The
proof originates in Cantor's diagonal, and indued Turing's undenabilty of the Halting
problem.
It must be remarked that the usual interpretation of the rst inompleteness theorem, the
mismath between provability and truth although tehnially orret is perhaps mis-
leading : one gets the impression of a totality (the true statements) that one annot reah
(by formal methods). . . But is there oneptually speaking suh a totality ? I don't
know, and I would guess that this totality is nothing more than a (onvenient) onvention.
By the way, the rst inompleteness theorem an be restated as the existene of a losed
formula that annot be proved nor disproved, whih means that provability is inomplete in
itself.

 Gustave funtion
This fantasti ounterexample is due to Berry (Berry, 1978) and is a major ontribution to
the theory of sequentiality. The Gustave funtion takes three Boolean arguments and returns
LOCUS SOLUM 121
a ompletely irrelevant output. The equations are the following
G(tt; ff; z) = a
G(x; tt; ff) = b
G(ff; y; tt) = 
G(tt; tt; tt) = d
G(ff; ff; ff) = e
(208)
(the last two equations have been added to Gustave's denition to make the funtion total).
The algorithm thus dened is not sequential, i.e., when we ompute G, we have no rst
question to ask about the input (e.g., A Give me the rst argument B : in ase y = yy; z = ff,
then the rst argument is irrelevant). Of ourse, if one replaes the seond equation with
G(tt; tt; ff) = b
G(ff; tt; ff) = b
(209)
then sequentiality is restored.
In fat, Berry studied another ounterexample, the parallel or of Plotkin. This ounterex-
ample is refuted by oherent spaes
72
. The Gustave funtion is refuted by hyperoherenes.
In terms of logi, Gustave an be rephrased as the would-be proof of ` A  (B & C); A

 Halting problem
When a program gets stalled, an you deide whether or not to use C- ? The answer due

 Harmony
Said Albert Camus
73
in 1957 : A Entre la justie et ma m√®re, je hoisirai toujours ma m√®re. B
We an imagine that the tension between spiritual i.e., traditional logi and loative logi
will inrease : between the respet of priniples (ompleteness et.) and harmony (prenex
forms et.), harmony is preferable. Completeness is a valuable priniple, a way of organising
the logial spae, but is inompleteness that bad ? Arithmeti is inomplete, and perhaps
slightly more interesting than the omplete prediate alulus.

 Herbrand model
Typial antiphrases : Herbrand onstruted a quantier-free theory, whih annot be treated
as a model, unless one insists on moking lassial logi. For instane, instead of provability,
some speak of truth in the A least Herbrand model B. . . As soon as they depart from the
basi prediate ase, these A Herbrand models B beome a true nonsense.
See : Antiphrases, Blak Mass, Classial model, Non-monotoni logis, Proofs vs. mod-

 Heyting's semantis
Also due to Kolmogorov, the semantis of proofs interprets proofs in a funtional way, A A
proof of A ) B is a funtion mapping proofs of A to proofs of B B. This preguration
of Curry-Howard, whih is perfetly orret by the way, had a diult life in partiular
beause of setarian polemis.
See : Brouwer, Curry-Howard, Logial relation, Realisability, Saaty volume.
 Higher order logis
Generalisations of logi above the seond order. There is a strong dierene between rst
and seond-order, but third order is very muh like seond order ; it is also of little use, but
for the writing of easy papers ; one an use the Emas ommand M-x higherorder-my-file
to that eet. This is an example of really formal mathematis, doable by a omputer.
See : Formalisable, Gestiulation.
 Hilbert
Launhed his famous program on onsisteny proofs in the twenties ; see for instane (Hilbert,
1926). The program was refuted by G√∂del's inompleteness theorem in 1931, whih didn't
prevent people from ontinuing the program. What is remarkable is not this illustration that
beliefs are stronger than truth, but that essential ideas typially sequent alulus ame
out of the program. The program is therefore the paragon of the good question : a denite
negative answer, and outstanding side eets. Of ourse these side eets have been found
long long ago, in the thirties, so maybe people should work on something else. . .

D in rooms 3; 36; 39 and E in rooms 22; 40; 64

 How and why
The why is the question everybody would like to answer, a noble question. Logi has been so
far onerned itself with the why, typially A foundations B. The modesty of the output only
mathed the pretension of the question. I do think that logi should rather look at the how,
i.e., the immanent strutures at work. Only when a ritial amount of materials is gathered
we an start to partly ope with the why.
See : Construtivism, Construtivity, Foundations.
 Hyperoherene
An
75
analysis of sequentiality, as it is desribed in the sequential algorithm model of Berry
and Curien (Berry and Curien, 1982), rst led Buiarelli and Ehrhard to the notion of
strong stability. A strongly stable funtion is required to preserve more meets than simply
those of all bounded sets (Buiarelli and Ehrhard, 1993). Then Ehrhard introdued hyper-
oherenes in (Ehrhard, 1995), a model of linear logi where morphisms are strongly stable.
Hyperoherenes are hypergraphs whereas oherent spaes are graphs. He also showed that
the hyperoherent hierarhy of simple types is the A extensional ollapse B of the sequential
algorithms hierarhy in (Ehrhard, 1999), and van Oosten and Longley obtained similar
haraterisations in realisability settings (Van Oosten, 1997; Longley, 1998).

 Illusions
Ludis denitely establishes the falsity of ertain spiritual priniples at work in mathemat-
is, espeially in ategory theory. This should not be taken as an attak against ategory-
theory, not to speak of the fat that I perhaps do not know my free-and-bound-variables.
Category-theory played an immense role in the dislosure of linear logi, ludis, in the or-
ret understanding of intuitionisti logi. . . We now realise that it is not that ultimate tool,
so to speak we lose our illusions. But nothing is more helpful than an illusion.
See : Category, Mistake, Spiritualism.
 Impliit
Realism is unable to understand the impliit. The natural tendeny is therefore to reify the
impliit in favour of all possible developments. Typially, a nite dynamis will be exhanged
with stati invariants like in denotational semantis. . . Mathematially speaking, the method
is beyond ritiism, but there is something unsatisfatory about it, espeially when we push
impliit towards potential.

 Inarnation
In a behaviour G, the inlusion between designs generates an equivalene relation and de-
signs of G should be onsidered up to this equivalene. But fortunately, eah lass has a
distinguished element : the inarnation jDj is the part of a D whih A matters B w.r.t. be-
haviour G, and this part has the good taste to be a design of G. The typial example is
that of a behaviour A With B G&H whih is the intersetion of its two supertypes G;H.
If D 2 G&H, then jDj
G&H
= jDj
G
[ jDj
H
, the union being disjoint. This is known as the
mystery of inarnation
jG&Hj = jGj  jHj (210)
This is an equality, not an isomorphism, provided one uses the loative produt.

ning.
 Inompleteness
Something is missing. For instane Peano's arithmeti does not prove all arithmetial truths.
The question is whether inompleteness refers to an ideal totality (maybe out of reah), i.e., a
(or several) potential ompletions. In ludis inompleteness is the pregnany of the biorthog-
onal.
G√∂del's inompleteness is of an enumerative nature, a variation on Cantor's non-denumerability
of reals, and applies in the presene of existential seond-order quantiers. Ludis explains
this phenomenon by the impossibility of giving a deloated denition of seond-order quan-
tiation for reasons of ardinality, Herr Cantor. But more primal forms of inompleteness,
of non-enumerative nature appear, typially prenex forms. All these examples orrespond to
unions G [H 6= (G [H)
??

 Inonsisteny proof
If we take the standard pauper vision of logi, namely that something is true as long it
has not been disproved, then our knowledge should derease. Eventually, what remains ?
Perhaps nothing. . . This is why there are so many attempts at proving inonsisteny : for
instane in Marh 2000 I got two new refutations of Cantor's diagonal argument.
See : Armageddon, Cantor's diagonal, Fermat, Pauperism, Unfalsiable.
 Infinitary logis
Sh√ºtte reformulated Gentzen's seond onsisteny proof (Gentzen, 1969b) as a full ut-
elimination result in a system of innitary logi. Although not diretly eetive, this sort of
logi has a good struture, and its proofs are designs in our sense, in other terms innitary
logi is part of ludis.
!-logi, mainly used by Sh√ºtte and his shool (Sh√ºtte, 1960a), orresponds to the speial-
isation of one quantier to natural numbers, yielding an innite rule, with ut-elimination.
The ordinal number 
0
is the natural bound ourring in the simplest non-trivial ut-
elimination. Later on I introdued 
1
2
-logi (Girard, 1984), whih is more innite than
!-logi in terms of logial omplexity, but more nite (e.g., involves less odings) on other
grounds.
The major limitation of innite logis is their diult relation with nite systems, typially
atual innite proofs are reursive, and one must at some moment enode by means of ad
LOCUS SOLUM 125
ho reursive indies. . . whih is denitely ugly. Innite logis have large wings but small
feet : A Ses ailes de g√©ant l'emp√™hent de marher B.
Ludis naturally aepts any form of innitary proof ; well-foundedness onditions for !-

 Intelligene
The problem of mahine intelligene, what a question. . . If we go bak to An-fang, where

 Intensional
The expression A intensional B (together with its aomplie A extensional B) is one of those
expressions like A meta B, A prediative B harateristi of Jurassi logi
76
. One an get
a rough idea of the quality of a paper by the frequeny of suh words. But what are the
possible meanings of A intensional B ?
Spiritism : The most vulgar meaning, almost magial, of some inaessible soul behind
material things : the pedestal table is the extension and the talking spirit is the inten-
sion. . . Positivisti irrationalism at its apex, for whih Oam's razor does wonders.
Forgetting : The idea that a rude denition an be rened. For instane in domain the-
ory the expression A extensional order B suggests that the stable ordering is intensional,
whatever this means. . . In topology, this would amount to style pointwise onvergene
extensional and uniform onvergene intensional. By the way, ludis dened the A ex-
tensional B order  in terms of orthogonality of designs, but the stable order (inlusion)
an also be dened by orthogonality :
D  D
0
, 8 E  E
0
( D j E = D j E
0
 \  D
0
j E ) (211)
Hene the distintion is just a matter of knowing what we are talking about.
Introspetion : However one an imagine properties that are purely internal, introspetive
so to speak. This is the ase of the winning properties of designs, whih do not refer to
the result of an interation, but to the interation itself.

 Interferene
Interferene is a typial loative phenomenon, due to the fat that two behaviours share
ertain loi. Spiritual logi avoids interferene by means of systemati deloations. The good
point of deloation is that bad jokes like true true = false, see 8.2.2, false false = true,
see 8.2.3 are impossible, so that we an get external ompleteness. But interferene has pos-
itive aspets too, typially the new prenex forms ome from the sharing of loi. To sum up,
the hallenge is not to banish interferene, but to ontrol it.

 Intersetion type
Intersetion
7879
types were introdued about twenty years ago (Coppo et al., 1981), to
inrease the typability power of Curry's type disipline. The intersetion type disipline
allows to desribe and apture various properties of -terms, and it has also a very distintive
semantial avour. In fat, intersetion type assignment systems an be viewed as nitary
logial denitions of the interpretation of -terms in a partiular lass of models of -alulus,
the lter -models. Namely, a typing judgement an be interpreted as saying that a nite
element of a model (desribed by a type) belongs to the interpretation of a given term
(Honsell and Ronhi, 1992). The importane of intersetion types depends on the fat that
the most interesting models of -alulus, those based on ontinuous algebrai latties and
oherent spaes, an be desribed as lter -models.
See : -alulus, Subtyping, Torino Shool.
 Introspetive
I propose to replae the suspet expression A intensional B by A introspetive B, with an
opposition to A extrospetive B : typially everything dened in terms of some sort of or-
thogonality, logial relations. . . is extrospetive, but winning onditions are introspetive.

 Intuitionisti logi
The rst real A alternative logi B, due to Heyting. Tehnially speaking, the intuitionisti
sequent alulus aepts only one formula to the right of sequents, whih makes ontration
impossible, so that modulo ut-elimination one gets the disjuntion and existene prop-
erties. The only limitation of intuitionisti logi is the absene of a real negation. For the
geometri meaning of negation is the exhange left/right, but how an you swap between
zones with dierent maintenanes ? This is preisely the point of the ::-interpretation.
Linear logi reintrodues the symmetry by systematially forbidding weakening and ontra-
tion, not out of some hyporitial A at most one formula there B, but as a general priniple.
As a result, negation beomes involutive, whereas weakening and ontration beome at-
tributes of speial onnetives, exponentials.

i.e., there is only one rule whih produes this formula, and the rule an always be applied.
This remark oming from the proof-searh ommunity is very deep : in presene of a
luster of negative formulas, we an iterate the inversion, so as to get several rules done in
a single step, a syntheti onnetive. It turns out that half of onnetives are negative, and
the other half, the positive ones an be handled by means of a dual property, foalisation.
See : Foalisation, Polarity, Proof-searh, Syntheti onnetive, Time in logi.
 Isomorphism
In ategory theory, one denes the notion of a anonial isomorphism, whih is quite an
ahievement. In ludis, we prefer plain equalities, a matter of taste. . . But this is not a
matter of taste : the prenex forms annot be explained by isomorphisms, you badly need
equalities !
See : Bergen, Category, Prenex form.
 Joke
Sienti standards are terrible, one should never joke
80
: to be taken seriously, put people
to sleep ! In a paper, no funny drawings, it would be a waste of paper. However, full pages
of repetitive denitions, of Prussian formalism, are not onsidered as a waste.
A good joke makes you understand a omplex methodologial point. For instane, when I
say that a onsisteny proof is like an insurane against the explosion of Earth, you get it
diretly. However, some jokes are dishonest, sine they don't respet the very spirit of what
they are alluding to, typially the allegory of the prisoners.

 Kepler
The omputer program BACON of Nobel Prie winner H. Simon was given the distanes
of a planet from the sun together with their period of revolution and it independently
redisovered Kepler's third law, illustrating how far the positivism at work in A AI B an go.
But Kepler's ahievement was not to determine a straightforward relation between two
rows of numbers: it was to gure out whih numbers should be related, and Kepler's real
ahievement was atually to nd the right question. Inidentally, Kepler stated a fourth law
relating planets with perfet polyhedra, and one wonders why this fourth law has not been
redisovered by omputer yet, independently of ourse. . . The same method works regularly
for another astrologer, Nostradamus.

 Kreisel
One of the greatest logiians of last entury, partiularly ative in the sixties. With respet
to proof-theory, he tried to disard all ideologies : dixit van Heijenoort A Il fait pr√©ipiter les
grandes formations brumeuses. B Kreisel was a strong opponent to A so-alled onsisteny
proofs B. His reetion shema, whih internalises the relation syntax/semantis, is typial
of his style : the Tarskian nonsense, one formalised, beomes a non-trivial tool. But in
reality this is ut-elimination that makes things work. With respet to intuitionism, he
was less suessful, beause he tried to formalise too muh, so as to sometimes ompletely
miss the point, like in the notorious Saaty volume aair.

feed a horse with gasoline. Intuitionisti logi is not about provability, but about proofs. The
same applies to the phase semantis of linear logi ; but it is muh easier to gestiulate with

 La Palie
Famous for the sentene A Un quart d'heure avant sa mort il √©tait enore en vie B : the
stupefying remark that, when you are not dead, you are in life, and this stated in 1525, four
enturies before the denition of Tarski A A^B is true if A is true and B is true B ! This is
why the Lapalissian notion of truth, known as A v√©rit√© de la Palie B is so famous in Frane,
more famous than the Tarskian one, typially if somebody says A I prefer to be rih and
beautiful than poor and ugly B, we don't all it a A v√©rit√© √† la Tarski B but a A lapalissade B.
To be fair to Tarski, he invented the meta whih allows one to distinguish between ^ and
A and B. To be as strong as the Tarskian truism, La Palie should have written something
like A Un quart d'heure avant sa mort il remarqua qu' il √©tait enore en vie B.

 Laplae
A major
81
mathematiian, known for his seminal work in Innitesimal Analysis, Astronomy,
Probability Theory. Laplae proposed a paradigm for the mathematial analysis of Physis,
the so alled A laplaian determinism B. In this perspetive, the systems of (dierential)

LOCUS SOLUM 129
equations ould ompletely desribe the physial world. More preisely, if one wanted to
know the state of the physial world in a future moment, with a given approximation, than
it ould sue to know the urrent state of aairs up to an approximation of a omparable
order of magnitude. By formally omputing a solution of the intended equations, or by suit-
able approximations by Fourier series (as it will be said later), one ould dedue (or predit
or deide) the future states, up to the expeted level of approximation.
Poinar√©, as a onsequene of his famous theorem on the three bodies problem, proved that
minor variations of the initial onditions ould give enormous hanges in the nal result
or, even, that the solutions ould depend disontinuously on the initial onditions. Then,
preditability, as A ompleteness w.r.t. the world B of suitable sets of dierential equations,
failed.
About one entury later, Hilbert resumed Laplae's program in a dierent ontext. He rst
set the basis for the rigorous notion of A formal system B, as well as for the distintion be-
tween A theory B and A metatheory B. He later onjetured that the key system for Number
Theory, Peano's Arithmeti (where he had interpreted Geometry, 1899), was omplete w.r.t.
the intended struture of numbers (or that any assertion about the A world of numbers B
ould be deided by formal or A potentially mehanisable B tools).
A few soon reated to Hilbert's program, suh as the A lone wolf B among Hilbert's students,
Hermann Weyl, who (hesitantly) onjetured in (Weyl, 1918) (notie the date !), the inom-
pleteness of formal arithmeti (end of x3). He also rmly stressed in several plaes that the
idea of mehanisation of Mathematis trivialises it and misses the referene to meaning and
strutures. Besides Weyl (and Poinar√© and a few others), Wittgenstein is another thinker
who ritiised Hilbert's program. For him A Hilbert's metamathematis will turn out to be
a disguised Mathematis B (Waismann, 1979), sine A [A metamathematial proof‚ÑÑ should
be based on entirely dierent priniples w.r. t. those of the proof of a proposition . . . in no
essential way there may exist a meta-mathematis B, sine . . . A I may play Chess aording
to ertain rules. But I may also invent a game where I play with the rules themselves. The
piees of the game are then the rules of hess and the rules of the game are, say, the rules
of logi. In this ase, I have yet another game, not a metagame B, see (Wittgenstein, 1968).
As for formal Arithmeti the key theory for nitisti foundationalism these remarks may
be now understood in the light of G√∂del's Representation Lemma (G√∂del, 1931) : by this
very tehnial result, one may enode the metatheory of arithmeti into arithmeti itself,
thus the A rules of the metagame B are viewed just as . . . rules of the A arithmetial game B.
Moreover, many proofs, whih entail the onsisteny of Arithmeti e.g., normalisation of
system F and Takeuti's onjeture (Girard, 1971) need a blend of metalanguage and lan-
guage ; or even purely ombinatorial statements e.g., Friedman's Finite Form of Kruskal's
theorem provably require the same entangled use of metatheory, theory and semantis,
by the A imprediative B notions involved (see (Harrington et al., 1985)) ; an indiret on-
rmation of Wittgenstein's philosophial insights (and Weyl's, as to inompleteness).
Both Laplae and Hilbert programs whih are stritly parallel and ontributed to posi-
tivist philosophies in physis and in mathematis opened the way to very relevant math-
ematial work : when preise and robust, even wrong programs may be have extraordinary
developments (XIX

entury Analysis, partly motivated by the laplaian A alulus of (grav-
itational) pertubations B or the rigourous notions of mehanisable omputation of the '30's
and their fall-out : atual omputers, as purely A theoretial B symbol pushers). However, the
orresponding inompleteness theorems, Poinar√©'s and G√∂del's or more reent A onrete B
Jean-Yves Girard 130
ones suh as the two mentioned above, should nally take us away for the underlying philoso-
phies, also to go further with mathematis. Poinar√©'s result, for example, is at the origin
of beautiful and new mathematial theories (the geometry of dynamial systems), where
qualitative preditions replae quantitative ones and the A mathematial understanding B
does not need to oinide with ompleteness or preditability by formal tools. In mathe-
matial logi we are not yet at a similar revolution, but the basis are being set towards
breaking the metaphysis of the relevant, but artiial, organisation of the disourse pro-
posed by Hilbert, the theory/metatheory frame. Similarly, we have to overome the belief
that language A prediates B about the world : language and strutures (of mathematis, of
physis) are in permanent resonane. They onstrut themselves while singling out onepts
and objets, in a permanent tension whih requires a parallel analysis of the foundation of
these disiplines.
One futher step is being now taken. XX
th
entury physis departed from the newtonian
A ausal lawfulness B of nature (and the mysterious instantaneous ations at distane, suh
as gravitation) and stressed the geometri struturing of the world : the latter gives the
geodesis and provides a uniation even with most reent advanes in mirophysis. In a
sense, it is the struture of spae and the loation only, that matter. See (Longo, 2001) for
further remarks.

 La√ºhli semantis
L√§uhli's
82
ompleteness theorems (L√§uhli, 1970) for intuitionisti propositional and pred-
iate logi were inuential preursors to many modern developments : logial relations,
ategorial proof theory, full ompleteness theorems. . . His semantis interprets provability
in the ategory of hereditary permutations (i.e., sets-with-permutations, with equivariant
maps) by the existene of an invariant element in the interpretation of eah formula.
Tehnially, it says the following for propositional alulus : A A f>;^;);_g-formula  of
intuitionisti propositional alulus is provable if and only if for every interpretation of its
atoms, its meaning [[‚ÑÑ‚ÑÑ ontains an invariant element. B
While ultimately this semantis is a semantis of provability, this was the rst attempt to
abstratly haraterise a "spae of proofs".

 Leakage
The entral problem of logi : the logial rules are known for enturies, but how do we justify
them ? In fat it is easy to interpret them in various strutures : sine logi is natural, the
interpretation works. But eah struture usually interprets some extra priniple, never the
same. Ludis is the rst non-leaking explanation of logi.
Leakage is very useful, for it indiates where to searh, what to modify ; this is why the
attitude onsisting of replaing the natural denitions by something ad ho, e.g., parsimony
with exatness to get a full ompleteness result, is deontologially wrong : when there is a
mismath, one should enlarge the gap, so as to understand what is wrong.

 Lemma
A lemma is muh more important than a theorem, sine it is more likely to be reused. This is
why some of the most important theorems of ludis have been alled lemmas. Mathematial
reation is basially about nding plausible lemmas, then establishing them, possibly with
the help of other lemmas. The opposition between Lupin and Holmes is very instrutive : they
both reognise that reasoning goes bakwards, but Lupin will insist on intuition, whereas
Holmes will onsider this as a mehanial ativity. Tehnially, one is with uts (the lemmas)
the other is ut-free.

 Lewis Carroll
Rev. Dodgson is remembered for Alie in Wonderland, not to speak of the photos of young
Alie Liddell. As a logiian he was one of the originators of this idea of logi-as-a-puzzle :
A You are a logiian, you must be warped B and is one of the preursors of this monument
of vulgarity, G√∂del-Esher-Bah. However it is not impossible to nd some ideas in Lewis
Carroll, for instane :
Ahilles and Tortoise argue about logi. Ahilles wants to infer B from A and A ) B ;
Tortoise aepts (A^ (A) B)) B) but refuses the Modus Ponens, i.e., refuses B ; Ahilles
tries again with (A ^ (A) B))) B and A ^ (A) B) ; Tortoise aepts
(A ^ (A) B) ^ (A ^ (A) B))) B)) B, but refuses the Modus Ponens, et. Eventually
this is a good joke that may help to understand ut-free provability.

 Linear logi
Linear logi, (Girard, 1987a), (Girard, 1995b) appeared as a by-produt of oherent seman-
tis. The novelty was the emphasis on strutural rules, thus individuating linear negation.
Linear logi is spiritual, like lassial and intuitionisti logis.

 Linear negation
Stability in oherent semantis says that a question on f(a) an be replaed with a question
on a. In other terms, every funtion has an adjoint, a sort of feedbak. This is the basi
meaning of negation, the exhange of questions and answers, input and output. Before the
invention of linear negation, an interative interpretation of logi was out of reah, sine the
partners were delared unequal ; linear negation is just the involution that exhanges the
players.

zen, Material impliation, Orthogonality, Pull-bak, Stability, Test.
 Loative logi
If usual logi is spiritual, the new logi should be temporal, to stik to religious terminology.
The word has already been taken for a bleak ativity, so the new logi will be loative.
The main question is what to do with the new operations, the new priniples. Denitely
Jean-Yves Girard 132
not turn them into some syntatial hewing gum, at least not systematially. Sine internal
ompleteness works for ertain loative operations (intersetion types, tensor of independent
behaviours) it is of interest to try to formalise this part ; but the wildest things, the inom-
plete new onnetives, inomplete but stritly assoiative et. should nd their use. Perhaps
it is possible to study them and to apply them diretly, after all other parts of mathematis
use inomplete objets and don't seem to suer too muh from the want of syntax. Perhaps
we eventually get the logial ounterpart of proess algebras.

 Loative produt
Let us start with the sum X + Y = X  f0g [ Y  f1g. Its main virtue is to soialise X;Y
up to isomorphism ; it indues remarkable properties summarised by the ardinal equality
‚ÑÑ(X + Y ) = ‚ÑÑ(X) + ‚ÑÑ(Y ) (212)
However this beautiful spiritual notion is neither assoiative, nor ommutative and without
neutral. The non-trivial ahievement of ategory-theory was to understand the meaning of
A . . . -ity up to isomorphism B.
If we dene the A deloations B (X) = X  f0g, 	(X) = X  f1g, we see that
X+Y = '(X)[ (Y ), i.e., that the sum an be redued, modulo deloation to the union. . .
whih is truly (i.e., stritly) ommutative, assoiative, et. but soialises in a hazardous way :
typially the ardinal equality beomes an inequality
‚ÑÑ(X [ Y )  ‚ÑÑ(X) + ‚ÑÑ(Y ) (213)
The sum is spiritual, the union is loative ; one must admit that, if the sum is more useful,
the union is more essential, primal.
The same happens with the notion of Cartesian produt of sets ; the familiar notion whih
satises the ardinal equality
‚ÑÑ(X  Y ) = ‚ÑÑ(X):‚ÑÑ(Y ) (214)
is assoiative, ommutative, et., but only up to (anonial) isomorphism. However onsider
the A loative produt B X
S

Y = fx [ y;x 2 X; y 2 Y g : this one is quite assoiative,
ommutative, with f;g as neutral ; of ourse its soialisation power is expressed by the
inequality
‚ÑÑ(X
[

Y )  ‚ÑÑ(X):‚ÑÑ(Y ) (215)
The usual produt (or rather an isomorphi variant of the usual produt) an be dened
from the loative produt as (X)
S

	(Y ).
In ludis one disovers that onnetives have more primal loative versions, see the four loa-
tive tensors. These onnetives are not that bad sine they enjoy many properties, typially
assoiativity ; the onnetives we are austomed to are just deloations '(A)  (B). The
deloated versions are more likely to be omplete, et., but their properties are only up to
isomorphism.
See : Bergen, Inarnation, Loative logi, Mystery of inarnation, Tensor produt.
 Lous
Literally A plae, loation B. The word refers to the spatial loation of a formula. But what
ould be the address of a formula ? The question makes sense as a relative one : assume
LOCUS SOLUM 133
that we are only interested in A, then we an surely loate A where we want, typially at
the root hi of a tree. Now a ut-free proof of A will make use of subformulas of A and these
subformulas an be loated inside the subformula tree of A ; in this way any formula involved
in a proof of A reeives a preise loation. However observe that several ourrenes of the
same subformula reeive distint loations.
We do not neessarily follow syntax in a strit way : we replae onnetives with A syn-
theti B ones, i.e., we apply foalisation, so that we are not seeking immediate subformulas,
but rather immediate subformulas of the opposite parity. In the ase of simple binary on-
netives (typially in the multipliative/additive fragment of linear logi), it is simple to
determine the subformulas and to loate them ; this beomes more deliate in the ase of
exponentials (beause of the ontration rule) and quantiers : the exat loations are not
that obvious to nd.
The most important point is that the negation A
?
of A will share the same address and
sub-addresses.

Not logis, as if there ould be as many logis as pages in a Handbook. . . By the way logi

 Logi plus ontrol
The drama of logi programming : logi was just seen as a way to pose the problem by an
ad ho formalisation, ompletely external to exeution, whih was a matter of engineering
skill. Control was made neessary beause of the ineieny of a systemati proof-searh, and
worked against logi. In fat logi programming makes sense only if the external (delarative)
logi is the same as the internal (proedural) logi. The oxymoron A logi plus ontrol B
expresses the refusal of suh a natural identiation.
See : Control, Logi programming, Oxymoron, Proedural logi.
 Logi programming
The paradigm of proof-searh, implemented in languages like PROLOG. The language was very
popular espeially beause of the 5
th
generation program
83
 The main idea of logi pro-
gramming was to speify logially a question and then to solve it by proof-searh. This was
a smart idea, but oversold. This style of programming is very eient in front of very basi
and repetitive tasks, think of the maintenane of a data base. But if you logially speify a
sorting question, the proof-searh mehanism will hardly be as eient as quiksort, not
to speak of mergesort. The reason is that these algorithms rely on smart lemmas, i.e., the
ut-rule, whereas proof-searh is without lemmas, without imagination. Instead of trying to
restrit logi programming to its eld of exelleny, a vehile that an y, swim, run et.
was reated, and didn't really work. . . not to speak of the fat that A ontrol B instrutions

were added, so as to tamper with the strit obediene to logi, destroying the original motto
A pose the problem, PROLOG will do the rest. B.
Present logi programming is more modest and more eient. For instane Andreoli in-
trodued logi programming in linear logi, (Andreoli and Pareshi, 1991), and in order to
improve eieny, disovered foalisation. See also (Miller, 1996) and (Cervesato and Pfen-
ning, 1996).

 Logial relation
Style of denition whih follows the logial onnetives, typially A f of type A) B is XXX
i for all a of type A whih is XXX, f(a) is XXX B. The idea is to show that everybody
is XXX, by indution on the onstrution of the objets. The method was suessfully used
by Tait in (Tait, 1967) to prove normalisation of G√∂del's system T, and later extended by
myself to ope with seond-order, so as to prove normalisation for system F or equivalently
Takeuti's onjeture. The additional ingredient is that of a andidate of XXX-ity (Girard,
1971).
The denition of behaviours in ludis follows the logial relation style, i.e., the set of designs
in the behaviour interpreting a formula is given in that way, but no other denition is given
in that style, this would onit with impliit requirements, suh as subtyping. By the way,
the logial relation style eventually redues to a denition by orthogonality.
Logial relations should be rejeted but for the denition of onnetives. But in their
day they had an immense value : a logial relation paraphrases the logial formula from
whih it omes. Change a minor point to logial rules in the Brooli style, and logial
relations give up : the evidene besides their apparent triviality that they know what
is/isn't logi. Of ourse they don't give you the soure ode, but at least you know that not
everything is like everything.

 Lorenzen
Lorenzen was presumably the rst to think of a dialeti logi, an interative interpretation of
intuitionisti logi. A strange idea for in the fties : intuitionism was not that popular in Ger-
many. . . and we an imagine that the idea of a dialeti interpretation of intuitionism must
have displeased the aging Brouwer. So there is a ertain originality up to marginality
in Lorenzen. It is diult to be fair to an enterprise that produed some of the masterpiees
of bureauray, typially (Lorenzen, 1960), (Lorenz, 1968) and (Felsher, 1985). In fat the
time was not ripe, and three basi events had not yet ourred, namely :
F The oniliation of onstrutivity with proof-theory, in whih Kreisel played a prominent
role.
F The Curry-Howard isomorphism, proofs-as-funtions before proofs-as-strategies.
F Linear logi, i.e., symmetry in onstrutivity, stritly neessary to a game-theoreti ap-
proah.
It is fair to quote Lorenzen, beause said Borges every revolution invents its own tra-
dition, and Lorenzen is somewhere on the trak. But the half-baked ahievements of this
Shool did presumably more harm than good to the idea of interativity in logi.

 Loser
The main disovery of ludis is that the logial spae is never empty, ontrarily to what
happens in usual leaking interpretations. The typial loser is a design in harge of A the rule
of the game B.
See : Contration, Completeness (external), Consensus, Dog, Game semantis, Leak-
age, Ludis, Paralogism, Winning.
 Ludis
Ludis arose as the study of the interation between syntax and syntax, typially in ut-
elimination. It was neessary to replae syntax with something more geometrial, and this
is why ludis lies in between syntax and semantis, as a A semantis of syntax-as-syntax B, a
monist explanation of logi. The thesis of ludis, already present in the programmati paper
(Girard, 1989b) is that logi reets the hidden geometrial properties of something.

Martin-L√∂f system
One of the great reations of the seventies, (Martin-L√∂f, 1984). Martin-L√∂f developed his
type theory, out of a very original philosophial analysis, ompletely alien to the Tarskian
truisms. The tehnial originality of the system lies in its basi primitive  2 A, something
like A  is a proof of A B. The most interesting onstrutions are by far the onnetives
Q
x 2 A B[x‚ÑÑ and
P
x 2 A B[x‚ÑÑ, the dependent produt and dependent sum.
See : Construtions, System F.
Material impliation
If B holds, A) B holds for material reasons, i.e., without ausality. The attempt at building
alternative logis on the mere refusal of this priniple, also known as weakening, was a failure,
for ontration has to be removed rst.

Maul
A typial introspetive notion : the maul is the proess of normalisation. Tehnially speaking
the maul is obtained by identifying, in a balaned slie, ations  with the orresponding
anti-ations e.

Mediine
The typial tehnique, with only positive information A As far as we know, one annot get
AIDS by blood transfusion. B Medial truth is therefore what has not been refuted so far.
Physiians therefore attempted at imposing their views to real siene : the pregnany of
formal protools, the mere idea of falsiability, et.

Jean-Yves Girard 136
Meta
An expression used to hide the absene of any mathematial idea ; the frequeny of this
word an serve as a rst indiation as to the quality of a work (for instane in the expression
A meta logial framework B)
84
.
The original Greek   is mainly around A besides, after B, and not at all around A be-
fore, original B. Typial uses are to be found in A metamorphosis, metaphor, metastasis B,
Aristotle's Metaphysis being the book after the physis. The expression has invaded all
human ativities : grammar should now be alled meta-language, I reently heard about a
meta-movie, tomorrow the onstitution will be alled the meta-law. . . let's hope that the
promoters of the meta will be paid bak in meta-money !
A Meta B is problemati sine too ambiguous : typially, take the Tarskian denition of
truth : it is urrently assumed that and exists before ^. But a more perspiuous analy-
sis in the ludi style would say that truth is nothing but a onvenient way to reet
properties of formalism : typially the reetion shema only works when the syntax enjoys
ut-elimination. It would therefore be more prudent not to try to make a hierarhy between
^ and and, i.e., to stik to the meaning A besides B, A paraphrases B, of A meta B.
Personally I never use this expression in front of hildren.

Metaphor
Certain basi features of linear logi were very well explained in terms of metaphors like the
gastronomi menu of Lafont. However one should avoid allegory, whih onsists in replaing
the objet with its metaphor.

ogy, Obfusation, Prisoners, Sokal, Square wheels.
Mistake
Ludis is based on voluntary mistakes, i.e., paralogisms. Paralogiians make mistakes too,
but they are involuntary. . . Just like the failure of the n+1
th
oensive of General Jore in
1915 was involuntary.
As pointed out by Cordwainer Smith, mistakes are essential to intelligene.

Mix rule
Alternative strutural rule
`   ` 
`  ;
(216)
The rule should not be taken as a partiular ase of weakening, sine the two premises are
supposed to ontribute to the onlusion. Mix appeared as a by-produt of oherent spaes :
the tensor produt of oherent spaes is not smart enough to refuse this rule. But in ludis,
it does not work, even as a paralogism : there is no natural way to mingle designs, and some-
times in presene of empty ramiations no way at all. This rule should be onsidered
as pure leakage, whih is not the ase of weakening or ontration.

LOCUS SOLUM 137
Money
A typial form of abstration ; for instane money is not supposed to light the replae, like
ordinary paper. The spiritual (if one an use suh a word) ontents of money is the gure
displayed, e.g., $20, and money usually interats on the mere basis of its nominal value.
However, there is a loative parameter, the series number, whih is used for seurity and
whih therefore belongs to the inarnation. Sine two distint notes of $20 have distint
numbers, i.e., distint loations, the tensor produt is a well-dened operation. But think
of gangsters half a banknote of $20 plus half a banknote of $20 hardly makes $20 unless
the series numbers math. A banknote is therefore the symmetri tensor produt of its
halves.
See : Abstration, Inarnation, Loative logi, Tensor produt.
Monism
A oneption in whih only one type of objet is at work, in sharp ontrast to dualism, based
on heterogeneity, think of matter vs. spirit, or syntax vs. semantis.
See : Corretness riterion, Dualism, Form vs. ontents, Ludis, Proof-nets.
Monsantism
Those multinationals onsider that sine their produts have not yet be proven to be
dangerous they are harmless, and they sent their warships everywhere, in a sort of new
Opium War : A Buy our hormones or
85
die B. It is interesting to remark the link with pau-
perism and more generally non-monotoni logis : something whih has not been disproved
is orret, and should even be treated A dedutively B. Here the dedutive treatment is to
fore everybody to buy those dubious produts.
See : Faith, Mediine, Non-monotoni logis, Pauperism, Reessive.
M√ºnhhausen
Hans Magnus Enzenberger used the well-known story of the Baron of M√ºnhhausen taking
himself out of water by . . . pulling his own hair, as a metaphor of G√∂del's inompleteness.
Saying that one annot x one's spetales while wearing them is less poetial, but loser
to the real point. Maybe the image an be reused to speak of paraphrases, whih is an
ambiguous ativity.
See : Dupond et Dupont, G√∂del's inompleteness, Metaphor, Paraphrases.
Mystery of inarnation
Imagine that Petruhio has an appointment with Catarina whom he didn't see for a long
time. Sine he has no idea as to her present behaviour, he brings with him a bunh of
owers. . . and a whip. Depending on her behaviour :
A nie girl : Gives the owers, and forgets the whip.
A bith : Flowers are good for nothing, uses the whip.
Depends on the weather : Keeps both items.
The three ases orrespond to three behavioursN;B;N&B, in the rst ase the inarnation
of your gift is F, in the seond ase it is W, in the third it is F [W. Hene your reied

Jean-Yves Girard 138
 Natural dedution
The main ahievement of Prawitz was the investigation of natural dedution in the mid
sixties : this was the rst manifestation of the internal power of language, the rst rupture
with this time of odings.
See : Churh-Rosser, Curry-Howard, -expansion, Prawitz, Syntax.
 Naturality
There are two meanings for A it is logi B : either A it is warped B, or A it is natural B.
Logi should be the most natural thing in the world, and if it is not, this is due to heap
explanations, not always honest : for instane, the presentations of G√∂del's theorem in the
logi-as-a-puzzle style insinuate that after all, this theorem is a very artiial thing. . .
See : Artiiality, Ludis, Lewis Carroll, Xenoglossy.
 Negation as failure
The priniple is more reasonable than the notorious losed world assumption : it says A if
proof-searh for A fails, A is false B, whih an be axiomatised, for failure is something that
you an observe, a sort of Daimon. The implementation was monstrous : take a onjuntion
A^B ; the algorithm will rst try A, and in ase it fails on A return a failure, but if we had
started with B, perhaps the evaluation loops, and no answer is returned. Is it a reason to
introdue non-ommutativity here and the endless ompliations that follow. . . surely not !
In fat this nonsense omes from the fat that negation as failure refers to a single evaluation
protool, whereas it should refer to all possible protools, good or bad, like in ludis. It is
surely possible to see the duality of ludis as the ivilised version of negation as failure.
See : Closed world assumption, Daimon, Halting problem, Logi programming, Ludis,

 Non-assoiative logi
. . . For want of anything worse.
See : Adjuntion, Assoiativity, Brooli logis, Gestiulation.
 Non-ommutative logi
I found the rst version of non-ommutative linear logi in 1987 (expounded by Yetter in
(Yetter, 1990)) ; the only limitation was that this yli linear logi exluded the ommu-
tative ase, whih is by far the most important. Long after, Ruet found a way to oniliate
ommutative and non-ommutative onnetives, and Abrusi haraterised the assoiated
proof-nets, see (Abrusi and Ruet, 2000). By the way, this is simply alled non-ommutative
logi, sine only a very bad Brooli logi ould be non-ommutative without being linear.
This logi is spiritual, and its interpretation in terms of ludis is an open question, whih
may involve additional struture in designs, typially ordered ramiations.
Ludis has a non-ommutative tensor,<, whih is loative. Four natural tensors arise, namely
GH;G<H;H<G;G:H, and they ollapse into the ommutativeG
H under a spir-
itual hypothesis : being alien. But these tensors are assoiative et. and they are omplete
under a weaker hypothesis : being foreign. The interest of our non-ommutative tensors (and
the extra ommutative tensor :) is that they do not require any additional struture, like
ordered ramiations. The problem is that they are not spiritual so that one doesn't see how
to onnet with the work of Ruet.

 Non-determinism
The fat that logi should eventually be non-deterministi is plain ommonsense to me. But
it is not beause you would like to get loser to say quantum mehanis that it works.
Ludis so far developed is deterministi, sine I was unable to nd enough non-determinism
in usual logi, I mean something that you an study, not a teratologial ompilation. The
things are likely to hange very quikly, roughly speaking by dropping oherene in the
denition of designs-desseins. Reent semanti developments by Buiarelli and Ehrhard
(Buiarelli and Ehrhard, 2000) go in the same diretion.
See : Dessein, Xenoglossy.
 Non-monotoni logis
It omes from the idea of making negation ommutes with provability. Unfortunately, one
should have taken negation in its most abstrat sense, namely A duality B. If not, one is
bound to onfuse A to know not B with A not to know B and to run aross the main negative
results of the thirties. The allegory of prisoners is a would-be justiation for this atroity.

Paralogis, Prisoners, Proofs vs. models, Siene, To know not and not to know.
 Normalisation
Usually a variant of ut-elimination. The expression is often used to stress some positive
points, suh as the uniity of the normal form. For instane usual sequent alulus enjoys ut-
elimination, but the algorithm is non-deterministi and yields several outputs, whereas nor-
malisation in natural dedution enjoys uniity of the output, the normal form, see (Zuker,
1974) for a disussion. Ludis use normalisation together with sequent alulus : this is be-
ause foalisation individuates an intrinsi timing of logi, with none of those unpleasant
ommutations at work in sequent alulus (and also in the ommutative onversions for 9;_
in natural dedution).
See : Churh-Rosser, Composition of strategies, Convergene, Cut-elimination, Diver-
gene, Maul, Pithfork, Proof-searh.
 Nostradamus
Abdution made a lot of progress in reent years ; for instane in 1937, a Mr. Ruir was
able to predit the Spanish Civil War by an abdutive reading of Nostradamus. Now, with
omputer-aided abdution, one has been able in 1998 to read bak the death of Priness
Diana in the verses of Nostradamus. . . unfortunately after the aident took plae.
See : Abdution, Astrology, Kepler, Sokal.
 Notations
There is something interesting in the hoie of notations in a new area. Typially when I
introdued linear logi, several alternative notations were proposed ; it is to be remarked
that the notation + (or ) ourred several times as a substitute to P. My point against
this was that you annot make an addition distribute over something, e.g., the additive
onjuntion & (that for some respetable reason one ould note ), think of
A+(BC) = (A+B) (A+C). . . I was answered that symbols are symbols and that one
an use them freely : one an all the table A horse B and the horse A table B ! The refusal
to give any speial status to essential mathematial features like distributivity betrays a
formalisti philosophy for whih everything is arbitrary, nothing is more important than
Jean-Yves Girard 140
another. . .
See : Artiiality, Coding, Numerology.
 Numerology
The tendeny towards numerology is impliit in formalism, typially with the abuse of od-
ing ; however the people know what they are doing and what they want to hide (usually
something awfully ad ho). In the various paralogis oming from so-alled AI say the
notorious abdution only remains a formal inantation, in whih formulas are treated as if
they had some esoteri, gnosti meaning. If many logial papers look like a religious servie,
here we get dangerously lose to the Blak Mass.
If you look at the literature, you will nd serious people that don't hesitate at publishing
pages of senseless ode the telephone diretory or worse as if the ultimate meaning ould
be there, in symbols, or maybe as if there were no meaning at all.

 Obfusation
Formalism is supposed to larify things, but it is often used to obsure them. How many
papers were published beause the referee quailed before unreadable formulas ? Beyond a
ertain degree of ryptation, everything looks the same. This explains also why some don't
hesitate at attaking olleagues on braketing, bound variables. . .
See : Bergen, Coding, Joke, Metaphor, Negation as failure, Numerology, Od-x, Savoir-
vivre, Square wheels.
 Objets and properties
Objets and their properties, here designs and behaviours. Should they be treated equally ?
The dominant positivisti view of logi had a tendeny to treat objets and properties in
the same way. If it is the ase that a omputer proess (here : the objet) gives its values
streamlike, why not extending the streamlike standards to properties ? In the same way,
the disovery of xed points in reursion theory, lambda-alulus, indued a notion of xed
point for properties (so-alled A reursive types B), whih is highly problemati, to be polite :
we know sine Russell's paradox that suh xed point need not exist. People naturally split
into two kinds :
F Those for whih properties are adverse to objets, anti-streamlike, reessive. Conretely,
properties are of the form A onsisteny B, i.e., 
0
1
(
1
in our lassiation). This is what
I all pauperism : the Hilbert tradition still A alive B in Jurassi proof-theory.
F Those for whih properties are friendly to objets, streamlike, expansive. Properties are
of the form A inonsisteny B, i.e., 
0
1
(
1
in our lassiation). Paralogiians are usually
on this side, something being true for want of a refutation.
But it is denitely impossible to restrit properties to 
0
1
or to 
0
1
. Objets and properties
are denitely not of the same nature.
Of ourse this ould bring us bak to dualism, properties as ideas, objets as matter. . . In
ludis, objets are designs, properties are behaviours, and superially a ertain dualism is
restored. I do believe that this dualism is due to the limitations of the mathematial language
whih must break the unity of things to analyse them. It is easy to understand that given
the right denition of design one an reonstrut behaviours, but this also works the other
way around : one entury ago, one basially knew the denition of a formula, and a long and
omplex proess made us understand that these formulas are atually inhabited, and who
LOCUS SOLUM 141
were the inhabitants. This shows that the idea generates the objet, and to some extent the
existene of both ideas and objets. But if behaviours generate designs, I hardly see how to
explain them as sets of designs suh that. . . Objets and properties, idea and matter, they
run together, and we should not try to separate them.

 Obstination
This is the most onspiuous winning ondition, sine it entails onsisteny. It says that
you are not responsible for the niteness of the dispute, i.e., you are not rst to give up.
When the two players are obstinate then nobody wins (dissensus) : in a behaviour there is
an impliit rule of the game beause the players are reasonably fair play, i.e., they are not
systematially obstinate, they an give up.
See : Barbihette, Dissensus, Dog, Loser, Winning.
 Oam's razor
One of the favourite expressions of Kreisel, alluding to the elimination of useless hypotheses,
seen as a useless beard. An abuse of Oam's razor would be systemati extrospetion, i.e.,
to judge things by their use, not by their immanent struture, think of Sherlok Holmes. Of
ourse, usual logial expressions like A intensional, meta, . . . B need a serious shaving, what
we did to some extent in this monograph.
See : Kreisel, Intensional, Introspetive, Meta, Paraphrases, Sherlok Holmes.
 Ourrene
Traditionally used to distinguish two dierent uses of the same formula, typially in A ` A,
one speaks of two ourrenes of the same formula A, as if we were speaking of twin brothers
as two ourrenes of the same person. The viewpoint of ludis is lear : there is nothing
like an ourrene, sine behaviours (whih orrespond to logial formulas) have loations :
dierent ourrenes annot be the same, but they an be isomorphi. The orret writing
should therefore be A

, where A

 Operational semantis
This is the sort of expression oming from omputer siene, and reeting the want of dy-
namiity of usual semantis : people like to oppose denotational and operational semantis.
However the omparison is unfair, for whatever an be the limitations of denotational se-
mantis, it is globally an exiting area with reasonably high standards. Nothing of the like
with operational semantis, whih independently of the real work done by people does
not go beyond the level of mere paraphrases.
Long ago (1987), I wanted to produe an A operational semantis B for linear logi. But
Longo onvined me that with the mathematial strutures I had in mind I should
better reate a new expression. . . This is the origin of Geometry of Interation, whih is of

B is unfair : in fat Gentzen
limits his transnite indution to very elementary properties quantier free and the gap
between arithmeti and the priniples used to prove its onsisteny is not that big, tiny
indeed. Nevertheless, G√∂del's inompleteness applies and Gentzen's onsisteny proof has
no value as suh for this reason. Ordinal analysis was ontinued by the followers of Gentzen,
Sh√ºtte, et. Ordinal Panzerdivisionen w.r.t. Panzerdivisionen of theories : none of the two
sides was very exiting. . . A lariation of the nature of their relation would have been
more onvining.

 Orthogonality
Orthogonality is loosely inspired from geometry. It took several forms :
Phase semantis : The basi idea was orthogonality of ontexts,  ? when `  ; is
provable.
Proof-nets : Orthogonality of permutations (Girard, 1988) or partitions in the style of
Danos & Regnier.
Geometry of interation : u?v i uv is nilpotent.
Ludis : D?E, D j E = Dai
All these denitions try to apture linear negation, seen as duality. The logial relation
style an eventually be redued to orthogonality, e.g., replae A F maps G into H B with
F?G
H
?

 Oxymoron
A gure of rhetoris based on opposition : there is an internal ontradition in A burning
snow B, not to speak of A Churh of Sientology B, or Amilitary justie B. In logi a very popu-

lar gure : for instane A philosophial logi B or A fuzzy logi B, in whih fuzzy, whih rightly
applies to the methods, the results obtained. . . is opposed to logi, in a sort of proterole.
Oxymoron hunting is an interesting ativity, reently I stumbled on A analytial philosophy B.

 Parallel or
An essential ontribution of Plotkin (Plotkin, 1977) to the theory of sequentiality :
P (tt; y) = tt
P (x; tt) = tt
P (ff; ff) = ff
(217)
There is no obvious sequential way to exeute the algorithm ; however, it an be interpreted in
Sott domains, with various onsequenes. Typially there is no minimum datum responsible
for
P (tt; tt) = tt
(218)
There are in fat two minimal hoies (tt; ;) and (;; tt), and the maintenane of Sott
domains fores one to enode the equation (218) by means of these two hoies and also
the non-minimal hoie (tt; tt), not to speak of the fat that one must explain the relation
between the various representations. . . Berry introdued stability to eliminate this ounter-
example, however stability is not enough to ope with the Gustave funtion.
See : Coding, Coherent spae, Gustave funtion, Pull-bak, Sott domain, Sequential-
ity, Stability.
 Paralogis
These A logis B with not even a dedutive system were proposed around 1980 by amateur
logiians. The ommon idea was to add a priniple of the form A If A is not provable, then
onlude :A B, in other terms, to make negation ommute with provability, an idea whih
is vaguely reminisent of the disjuntion and existene properties. Adding this priniple to
urrent formal systems makes them omplete (one among A;:A beomes provable), and
G√∂del's theorem destroys any hope to obtain a deent formalism for them.
The idea omes from a more general naive omputer siene attempt : make all programs
terminate by means of a A loop detetor B. But loops annot be deteted (this is the unde-
idability of the halting problem), so programs annot be A ompleted B into terminating
ones. By the way, the idea of ompleting programs or theories is as razy as the idea of
A ompleting B an unbounded operator on the Hilbert spae.
It is interesting to remark that this destrution of the dedutive paradigm was supposed to
improve lassial dedution, as well as the similar destrution of the omputing paradigm
was supposed to speed up omputation. . . but after all ommunism was supposed to improve
bourgeois (lassial) demoray.
To sum up, provability does not ommute with negation : A not knowing that B and A know-
ing that not B are essentially distint.

 Paralogism
Originally a mistake of logi, therefore frequent in paralogis. In ludis, there are paralogisms
too (typially the daimon, weakening et.), but they are not of the same nature : after all
our mistakes are done on purpose. They are so to speak A good mistakes B, essential to the
ompletion of the logial spae, and their disovery was a long and painful proess.
See : Artial Intelligene, Closed world assumption, Computer siene, Corretness
riterion, Dog, Loser, Mistake, Monism, Proof-net, Paralogis.
 Paraphrases
The fat that Ameta B is almost a pornographi expression does not mean that the expression
onveys nothing. After analysing, or shaving if you prefer, I retain only one meaning, that
of a paraphrases. The question is now to judge the value of paraphrases :
Very bad : A paraphrases explains nothing, it is a pure pleonasm.
Very good : It might be useful, think of abstrat mahines inuened by abstrat ate-
gories, of ertain uses of operational semantis. Self-interpreters, the reetion shema
are the best positive illustrations of paraphrases, and perhaps the notorious Baron of
M√ºnhhausen yields a reasonable metaphor for this ativity.
If we agree that a paraphrases explains nothing, we are redued to the seond aspet, i.e.,
to determine whether or not a notion an interat suessfully with its paraphrases, without
this hierarhisation impliitly at work in the expression A meta B. Then one disovers that
not everything admits a useful paraphrases, typially it will fail for a random Brooli
logi. The usual tool responsible for internalisations, reetions, self-interpretations. . . is
ut-elimination, whih is another name for internal ompleteness.

 Parsimony
This is one of the winning onditions, whih states that up to the fat that my opponent
perhaps prevented me from behaving I did onsume all the loi. In other terms, everything
reated is of some use. This introspetive notion reats against material impliation, i.e.,
weakening.
See : Ane logi, Barbihette, Dog, Dualiser, Exatness, Leakage, Loser, Material
impliation, Weakening, Winning, Xenoglossy.
 Partial design
This notion is relative to a given behaviour : D is partial in G when it is inluded in a (total)
design of G. Partiality is the ingredient of bihaviours. Observe that 
 is the only absolutely
partial design.
See : Biethis, Bihaviour, Faith.
 Pauperism
This is the right expression whih applies to the philosophy of Popper or at least to its
popular version : something is true as long it has not been refuted. In other terms a building
is safe as long it didn't ollapse (ommonsense would rather tell us that a safe building is a
building onstruted aording to good priniples, whatever this means). There is a onfusion
here between the fat that what we an observe say on a omputer is streamlike, and
the fat that abstrat entities should be streamlike (or anti-streamlike). The problem with
all those positivists is that they onsider theoretial thinking as the seretion of a sik gland
LOCUS SOLUM 145
brains, the use of whih should be minimised by all means.

Mediine, Monsantism, Objets and properties, Reessive, Stream.
 Perishable
Due to leakage, most semantis are perishable : a good semantis is replaed with a better
one, in order to x some problem, e.g., the mix rule. Paralogis are perishable too, one just
replaes something bad with something worse.
See : Artiiality, Categorial ompleteness, Leakage, Mix rule, Paralogis, Xenoglossy.
 PER-model
Originally an unpublished idea of Kreisel, 1958 (HRO : hereditarily reursive operations,
HEO : hereditarily eetive (or extensional) operations) extended to seond order by Troel-
stra (Troelstra, 1973) (HRO
2
) and myself (Girard, 1972) (HEO
2
) to seond order, i.e. to
system F ; later on HEO
2
was renamed A PER-model B. A type is seen as a set of pure
lambda-terms, together with a partial equivalene relation ; terms are interpreted forgetfully.
The struture of PER is still present in ludis, think of bihaviours.
See : Bihaviour, Forgetful interpretation, Quantier, Realisability, System F.
 Petri net
In spite of the early reognition by Asperti (Asperti, 1987) of the relevane of linear logi
to Petri nets, little ame out of it.
See : Gastronomi menu, Linear logi.
 Phase semantis
This is the A Tarskian B semantis for linear logi, but it is not a Brooli semantis. A phase
spae is nothing but a ommutative monoid together with a distinguished subset (represent-
ing ?). The basi notion is that of orthogonality, x?y , xy 2 ?, and the task of ludis was
to replae this orthogonality between elements of an abstrat (spiritual) monoid dened by
means of an abstrat set ?, with an orthogonality between onrete objets, designs, with
a A physial B sense.
In so-alled A substrutural logis B, nothing like phase semantis survives : people are work-
ing with quantales whose properties are hanged aording to the humour of the day, one
day Brooli, the next day Spinah. . . As shown in (Girard, 1999b), it is almost impossible
to tamper with phase semantis : we annot hange the properties of logi by hanging the
properties of the monoid, typially, if we drop ommutativity, we get. . . a non-ommutative
logi, sure, whih is also non-assoiative. Phase semantis is therefore relatively respetable :
like oherent semantis, it is part of the piture, a reasonable treason. To see that there is
something in it, just look at the work of Lafont (Lafont, 1996).
See : Brooli logis, Classial model, Design, Kripke model, Gastronomi menu, Or-
thogonality, Resoure, Substrutural logis, Treason.
 Philosophial logi
Same problem as with proof-theorists, but the internal lok shows A 1600 B.
See : Dualism, Oxymoron, Proof-theory, Relevane logis.
 Pithfork
What remains of a sequent when the formulas have been forgotten and only their loations
remain. A pithfork is like an eletroni interfae with plugs (the loi) but without the
speiations (the formulas). When we plug a handle with a tine, something happens, good
Jean-Yves Girard 146
or bad, whih is expressed by normalisation.
See : Cut-net, Dessin, Normalisation, Polarity, Reiation.
 Pleonasm
An essential gure, illustrated by La Palie, and more reently by Tarski : it onsists in saying
twie the same thing, to look deeper. Observe that the antiphrases A popular demoray B
is made more ruel by the use of pleonasm.
See : Antiphrases, La Palie, Oxymoron, Paraphrases, Tarskian semantis, Truism.
 Polarity
The distintion positive/negative (or synhronous/asynhronous, to stik to the Andreoli's
terminology) is general. It seems to break on propositional atoms, but this only an illusion,
these atoms refer to an unknown formula, quantied universally or existentially, and suh
formulas reeive a polarity as well, positive for X , negative for X
?
, i.e., we deide that we
are speaking of the unknown formula of a given polarity (+ by onvention, sine negation
is available to speak of  ). Exponentials were relutant to polarisation, and it took me a
ouple of years to gure out the real solution : !A is in fat #‚ÑÑA, where ‚ÑÑA takes the negative
A into something, still negative, whih is not quite a formula : like the formal atom NH
4
,
‚ÑÑA only exists in ombinations.
Polarity is the main key to ludis after linear negation, to be fair. First the notion of
immediate subformula is hanged to A the losest subformula of opposite polarity B. In this
way the impliit assoiativity of logi beomes an expliit feature of designs, the assoiativity
theorem. Seond, remember that sequent alulus is a mahinery devised to prove formulas,
not sequents ; then the use of foalisation enables one to restrit to sequents with at most
one negative formula : this is true for the onlusion, a sequent with a negative formula
omes through iterated inversions from sequents whih are ompletely positive, and a
ompletely positive sequent omes through foalisation from sequents with exatly one
negative formula.
A sequent ` P
?
; , with a single negative formula P
?
an be rewritten as P `   : this is
the origin of pithforks.
Polarity should be related to sequentiality whih deals with the determinism, not of the re-
sult of a omputation, but of the omputation itself. A sequential algorithm is an algorithm
with an impliit timing, and eventually, sequentiality is not about determinism, but about
time itself : sequentiality is perhaps nothing more than polarisation.

nentials, Foalisation, Invertibility, Gustave funtion, Pithfork, Sequantial algorithm,
Sequentiality, Shift, Time in logi, Weakening, Xenoglossy.
 Potential
This is an old logial item (potential vs. atual), whih gave nothing, due to the want of
imagination of the people in harge. Although ludis is written in plain set-theory, it should
be apparent that it is not ommitted to a partiular view of innity, see for instane the
streamlike features of designs. One of the present limitations of ludis is that it is however
still possible to handle potentiality by means of the set of its. . . potential atualisations. I
am sorry, if potential means potential, this set does not make sense, but how an I say this,
my God ?

 Prawitz
Prawitz was presumably the rst to preisely state the symmetries of logi : introdution
rules of natural dedution A math B the orresponding eliminations. The symmetry works
well for negative onnetives );^;8, but is more problemati for the positive onnetives
_; 9. Prawitz had deep insights, in partiular he thought that natural dedution was more
primitive than sequent alulus, whih must be manipulated with endless ommutation rules.
See : Natural dedution.
 Prediativity
Originally a mistake of Poinar√©, giving his own (half-baked) answer to paradoxes A An
objet should not be dened in terms of a set ontaining it B. Prediativity is a pure A ism B
whih yielded no output at all in almost one entury, think of so-alled prediative analysis
whih has been unable to tell the dierene between what is prediative and what is not.
Like onsisteny proofs, prediativity sells insuranes against Apoalypse, but at a heaper
prie : the prediativist heks the onformity of the system with his priniples like others
hek the onformity of food with the Book. Prediativism is like this Kosher vegetarian
restaurant with a unique dish, namely tomatoes without the juie. . . moreover there is a
shortage of tomatoes.
By the way, Kreisel, long ago remarked that A the smallest natural number suh that . . . B
is dened imprediatively, whih might be the deepest statement, not about prediativity,
but about natural numbers. . .
See : Consisteny proof, Intensional, Jurassi Park, Kreisel, Laplae, Proess algebras,
Proof-theory, Tradition.
 Prenex form
The usual polarities for quatiers are as follows : 8 is negative and 9 positive, and this indues
a ertain number of ommutations of quantiers with other onnetives. To summarise, 8
ommutes with negative onnetives, i.e., we an as we like extend or restrit the sope of the
quantier. Traditionally (i.e., when positive onnetives are involved), we an only enlarge
the sope of universal quantiation, e.g., replae (8dA
d
)
B with 8d(A
d

B).
But omes the quantiateur nouveau out of ludis, i.e., the positive version of 8 and the
negative version of 9 ; these two guys are needed if we want a lean approah to ommutation
8/positive and 9/negative. . . And the essential disovery : the ommutation works without
restrition, typially
Prenex forms do exist in ludis
86
.
Sine this may not be easily understood, let us take a plain realisability interpretation of
seond order logi : e r 8X (A[X ‚ÑÑ _ B[X ‚ÑÑ) i for all X either e = 1  f and f r A[X‚ÑÑ or
e = 2f and f r B[X‚ÑÑ. . . hene f r 8X A[X ‚ÑÑ or f r 8X B[X ‚ÑÑ. . . This shows that part of
the prenex forms were already there, but if somebody notied them, he must have asribed
it to one more leakage of the realisability interpretation.
This does not ontradit the disjuntion property, nor the existene property (as long as we
have a onrete quantiation on some data type, whih is not quite a quantier). This also
shows that our onstrutive prediate aluli are badly, very badly inomplete. Moreover

Vitorians used to put pants on donkeys. . . One must deide between tradition (usual logial
rules) and harmony.

 Prisoners
Two prisoners with a painted dot on the forehead blak or white must guess their own
olour ; they an see eah other, but of ourse they have no mirror ; moreover they have
been told that at least one of them has been painted white. The rst guy says A I don't
know B, hene the seond answers in turn A white B and is released.
This metaphor has been used to advoate various paralogis. But sine it was impossible to
produe any deent logial system, the original metaphor beame an allegory : for instane
it looks more spetaular with 25 persons, the A Corsian ukolds B who eventually kill
their wifes.
Instead of iterating this vulgar joke, one should rather understand what is wrong in the
basi ase : imagine that the rst to speak is an moron who saw a blak dot on the other's
forehead, but was unable to onlude. . . Everything relies on the pattern of an unbounded
dedutive power : if I don't know, I annot know. In other terms, one assumes nothing less
that the ommutation of provability with negation equivalently the identiation between
Faith and Daimon, in ontradition with the undeidability of the halting problem and
with the inompleteness theorem, not to speak of the ommonsense remark that the absene
of a red light is not the same as the presene of a green light.

 Proedural logi
Classial logi is about reality. But intuitionisti or linear logi are not about an external
reality, they are about themselves, about their own rules. This orresponds to the mathing
between the rules of logi and the logi of rules.

 Proess algebras
Milner's theory of onurreny evolved in the last ten years so as to inlude the idea of
mobility (the -alulus and its variants). These aluli always leak somewhere otherwise
why so many variants ? But this is not a reason for overlooking the input of these ideas, om-
pared to say ratioinations about prediativity. In partiular relations between ludis
and proess algebras are potentially of utmost interest ; of ourse one should try to interpret
-aluli inside ludis and not the other way around : for instane how ould one dene an
assoiative tensor produt in the absene of the basi adjuntions ? Some obviously loative
features of the -aluli should benet from a ludi interpretation ; on the other hand the
non-determinism of these aluli may have a feedbak on ludis.

 Proofs-as-programs
The idea is simple : use proofs (and ut-elimination) to write programs. This is a very
good idea, but whih gets stalled in pratie, for mathematis insists on the why whereas
omputer siene is polarised by the how. Typially one an prove that Frane is onneted
by showing that every town an be linked to Paris. . . but the program impliit in this proof
(and implemented by Frenh Railways) yields the notorious Web entred on the apital.
Anyway the idea is interesting, provided one tries to prove less brutal statements that A an
be linked B.
See : Expliitation, Expliit, Impliit.
 Proof-net
Surely the most original artifat of the paper (Girard, 1987a). Proof-nets are graphs, whih
present a non-sequential proof-system. Sine they have no expliit timing (unlike designs,
they have several sequentialisations), the question of the mere existene of a sequentialisation
beomes essential. The answer is known as the orretness riterion for proof-nets of (Girard,
1987a). This riterion was later simplied by Danos and Regnier, (Danos and Regnier, 1989).
More reently Guerrini (Guerrini, 1999) proved that the riterion an be heked in linear
time. There is also an interesting homologial interpretation of the riterion by M√©tayer
(M√©tayer, 1994). The importane of proof-nets lies in the early reognition (Girard, 1988)
that the swithings at work in proof-nets are homogeneous with proofs, sort of paraproofs :
this is the origin of our monist program.
See : Corretness riterion, Design, Linear logi, Monism, Orthogonality, Paralogism.
 Proof-searh
There are two religions as to proofs. The proof-theorist views them as given entities, bound
to be transformed via ut-elimination. On the other hand the adept of proof-searh, usually
not that eduated, but whose viewpoint is sometimes muh more reative (not to say more),
views the proof as a proess : starting with the onlusion, one produes a last rule, then
above a seleted premise of the last rule, yet another rule et. For the proof-searher, the
proof is never (or exeptionally) ompleted. The two viewpoints are not irreonilable, for
ut-elimination basially proeeds from the onlusion : only a trunated end-piee of the
proof loally matters. In other terms proofs are streams and the rst dierene between
proof-searh and proof-normalisation is that proof-normalisation onsiders that the proof is
omplete from the beginning.
The similarity between proof-searh and proof-normalisation has been blurred by heaps of il-
literate A improvements B of proof-searh, e.g., the notorious losed world assumption. People
went on onsidering proof-searh w.r.t. systems satisfying everything but ut-elimination :
in proof-normalisation, something is given impliitly (typially under the form F (A) whih
involves a ut between F and A), and we normalise it, whereas in proof-searh, only the
expliit, ut-free part of the system is used, and this is why those people tried to tamper with
ut-elimination. But this is nonsense, sine ut-elimination relates the output of dierent
omputations : imagine that we program a funtion F by means of proof-searh, and that
A evaluates as 0, and F (0) as 7 ; only ut-elimination an ensure that F (A) evaluates as 7
and not 38.
The distintion proof-searh/proof-normalisation is
87
obsolete. With adequate hypotheses,
87
Theoretially at least, the praties are so dierent !
Jean-Yves Girard 150
the two ativities oinide, at least formally. We have already notied that the streamlike
style makes the two notions of proof idential. The identiation beomes espeially lear
in ludis : a proof-searh for A is the same as the normalisation of a ut between A and
A
?
, the auxiliary proof of A ` orresponding to the ontrol on proof-searh. Let us just
give an example : at some moment you try to prove a formula A & B ; then you ask your
opponent A whih side B, and if the opponent answers A B B, you proeed with B. But you
an imagine that the opponent is unwinding a proof of A
?
B
?
, and that the premise B
?
has been hosen ; if you were normalising A & B against A
?

. . . By the way, observe that the daimon z has
a natural proedural interpretation : if I (proof-searher) use the daimon, this just means
that I give up ; if my opponent uses the daimon, this means that he was satised with the
portion of proof shown to him. Of ourse this view of proof-searh is not the building of a
omplete proof, but of some parts of it : in another round, the opponent may hoose A. The
separation theorem says that a real proof is determined by all these partial proofs.

 Proof-theory
The proof theorist is the guy that proposes Hilbert's Program as the hallenge for the new
entury, a vitim of the millennium bug so to speak.
See : Hilbert, Jurassi Park, Philosophial logi, Prediativity.
 Proofs vs. models
Surely the ultimate ahievement of ludis is the onept of design, whih unies the idea of
a proof and that of a model. D?E means that D is a sort of a model (or a ounter-model)
for E and vie-versa. Usually one models a theory and not a proof, and this is why naive
attempts at the same lead to various tortures of the idea of a lassial theory.
See : Blak Mass, Design, Herbrand model, Orthogonality, Non-monotoni logis.
 Propagation
Let us try to give the proedural interpretation of the ambiguity in the ontext splitting :
oming bak to the example in subsetion 1.3.2, it is fair to say that the rst rule didn't
deide anything as to the dispathing of ;  between 3 and 7. After this rst (i.e., this
ultimate) rule, ;  look like satellites of the twin stars   3 and   7, without any possible
way to tell the dierene. Only after a fousing has been made on  A above B   3, we an
tell that, on the whole,  belonged to   3, but nothing of the like happens for  . Proof-
searhers would say that the splitting of the ontext is dynamial ; a orret statement,
but less exiting than the idea of logial partiles whih have not yet deided about their
ultimate alloation. The ondition of propagation says that  annot belong to both of   3
and   7 ; one an imagine a negative message arriving at   7, and saying A sorry,  has
been onsumed somewhere, forget it and its subloi as well B.
See : Design, Dessein, Dessin, Proof-searh.
 Pull-bak
The notion of pull-bak, whih is the simplest form of an inverse limit, is one of the major
inputs of ategory-theory. It states the existene of a minimum (not minimal, minimum !)
witness to various problems. The major limitation of Sott domains was the absene of a
pull-bak ondition, a limitation that was later xed by stability, leading to oherent spaes.

 Quantifier
Any intersetion
T
i
G
i
of behaviours must be onsidered as a universal quantier, and du-
ally any A union B
U
i
G
i
as an existential quantier. Observe that the union does not witness
the opy (better : annot), so quantiation is rather like a omment %nexists i. Exis-
tential quantiers need not satisfy the existene property, whih is only useful for numerial
quantiers, whih are not quite quantiers.
The logial tradition, whih annot aommodate loative features, made a systemati on-
fusion between universal quantiation and innitary onjuntion with the exeption of
PER-models, where seond order quantiation is a plain intersetion. This onfusion is le-
gitimate at least plausible in the rst-order ase, sine one quanties over a denumerable
domain, so that we an deloate the A onjunts B. In the seond-order ase, this beomes
a nonsense, sine there are more behaviours on whih we quantify than available loi. As to
rst-order quantiation, besides the plain loative treatment stands the possibility of in-
terpreting quantiation as &
D
, indexed by the domain D together with a (nal) universal
quantiation over possible D .

 Question
What we are really after in siene : we are not seeking answers, but only the path leading
to answers. A good question is one that we an solve, a very good one reeives no denite
answers, but leaves a methodologial trak. The AI morons think that answers are more
important than questions.

Expliit, Expliitation, Fermat, Full ompleteness, Hilbert, Impliit, Kepler.
 Ramifiation
In a standard logial rule several immediate subformulas interat. The set of their (relative)
loations, i.e., biases, is a ramiation. A ramiation ours either as the indexing set of a
positive rule, or as the index of one of the premises of a negative rule.
See : Ation, Bias, Diretory.
 Realisability
The value of realisability is to present independently of setarian polemis an approxi-
mation to Heyting's semantis of proofs. Realisability supposes a spae with pairing, a naive
notion of funtion et. Partial reursive indies, pure -alulus and. . . designs satisfy these
requirements. In fat, if realisability didn't go that far, this must be asribed to the limita-
tions of -alulus (the want of duality).
One assumes that ar A makes sense for atomi A, then
Impliation : (f r A) B), (8a(ar A) f(a)r B).
Conjuntion : (r A ^B), (

r A ^ 

r B)
Disjuntion : (r A _ B), 9d(( = 1  d ^ d r A) _ ( = 2  d ^ d r B)))
Quantiation : (r 8X)A, (8C r A[C=X ‚ÑÑ)
The realisation of seond-order quantiation is in the style of Troelstra, (Troelstra, 1973),
i.e., by intersetion. Observe that suh a denition validates
(8XA[X ‚ÑÑ _ B[X ‚ÑÑ)) ((8XA[X ‚ÑÑ) _ (8XB[X ‚ÑÑ)).

 Realism
No doubt that there is a reality, whatever this means. But realism is more than the reogni-
tion of reality, it is a simple-minded explanation of the world, seen as made of solid briks.
Realists believe in laplaian determinism, absoluteness of time and refuse quantum mehan-
is : a realist annot imagine what Audiberti styled as la ser√®te noireur du lait . In logi,
realists think that syntax refers to some preexisting semantis.
Indeed, there is only one thing whih denitely annot be real : reality itself.
See : Dualism, Impliit, Jurassi Park, Laplae, Reiation, Siene, Syntax, Truth.
 Reessive
The more you know, the less you get, typially you need two blue genes to have blue eyes.
The positivists, from Hilbert to Popper , the Big Brothers of Monsantism, the various paralo-
giians, they all agree on that. That's a possibility, but there is a onit with deduibility,
i.e., portability, a statement that has not yet been refuted might be of interest to you, but
to make a law of it seems deliate, nay riminal. For instane I remember a very dangerous
woman who didn't know how to drive ; she was beloved by her insurane ompany believe
it or not, she had not the slightest rash in years. . . Surely the ompany was happy, but
ould we give her behaviour as an example ? Surely not : she stayed alive only beause the
drivers she met didn't behave in the same way.

 Reursive type
A typial oxymoron, for a type is a property, whereas only objets may have xed points in
full generality.
See : Falsiable, Fixed point, Pauperism, Objets and properties, Oxymoron, Stream.
 Reduibility
Originally a method introdued by Tait in (Tait, 1967). In the ground ase, reduibility
asserts normalisation ; it is extended to the general ase by a logial relation A f of type
A) B is reduible i for all a of type A whih is reduible, f(a) is reduible B. The seond-
order notion A andidats de r√©dutibilit√© B is my rst work (Girard, 1971). There is a vague
smell of this in the treatment of seond-order quantiation in ludis. Note that reduibility
is basially extrospetive.
See : Fixed point, Introspetive, Logial relation, Objets and properties.
 Referee
Usual A game semantis B interprets formula A by means of a game G between Proponent
who tries to prove A and Opponent trying to refute A, but there is a hidden third partner,
namely the referee in harge of the rule of G. But if A really refers to its negation and
vie-versa, one hardly see why there should be a third partner. With an adequate bribing of
the referee, you an basially validate whatever you like, using jokes of the form A Proponent
proposes a rule, Opponent says yes or no B. Behaviours leave no room for the referee.
See : Atomi weapon, Behaviour, Consensus, Dissensus, Full ompleteness, Type.
 Refletion shema
What is syntax, what is semantis ? At least the answer is not lear. The idea in (Kreisel
and Levy, 1968) was to internalise, so that the truth of A beomes A and its syntatial
LOCUS SOLUM 153
properties beome arithmetial properties of its G√∂del number pAq. In partiular, the formal
impliation REF
A
:= Thm(pAq)) A is established in Peano's arithmetihere Thm refers
to provability in a nitely axiomatised subsystem of Peano's arithmeti. The idea is to
internalise the brilliant Tarskian evidene that the axioms are true and that the rules of
inferene preserve truth. But a theorem of Tarski (indeed the rst inompleteness theorem
of G√∂del) makes this impossible : there is denitely no truth prediate. But, using the fat
that the proof uses a nite number of axioms and the subformula property, it is possible to
atually dene a bounded truth prediate that an ope with the situation. The parametri
version REF
A[x‚ÑÑ
:= Thm(pA[x‚ÑÑq)) A[x‚ÑÑ is a partiularly useful internalisation lemma, and
the reetion shema proves in turn that Peano's arithmeti annot be nitely axiomatised.
The shema is a lue as to the real meaning of truth, a notion perhaps without sense, but
that we an internalise. The reetion shema fails for Brooli logis : due to the failure of
ut-elimination, one an no longer bound the size of formulas in the proof of A. Contrarily
to a urrent prejudie, one annot tamper with the A meta-universe B.

 Reifiation
The typial reiation is the eventual output of an innite proess. Reiation is useful as
long as it is ompatible with the streamlike viewpoint ; beyond that point it only ontributes
to this ideology of another entury, realism. Typial reiations in the text are
Pithforks : One hardly knows the atual base of a pithfork, sine the ontext is split
dynamially.
Faith : The eventual output of a diverging omputation.
Inarnation : What is atually used in behaviour G depends of the will of your partner.
To be part of an inarnation, of a design is streamlike (expansive) (
0
1
), Faith (i.e., diver-
gene) is reessive (anti-streamlike). Eventually you will get the full inarnation of a design,
but you will never (
0
1
) be able to be sure of the divergene of normalisation. Depending
on the way we use them, pithforks will be streamlike or anti-streamlike.

mulas, Stream.
 Relevane logis
The idea of rejeting weakening omes from an old ritiism onerning material impliation
and popular among philosophers ; this was implemented still by philosophers and led
to various relevane logis.

 Resoure
The traditional interpretation of linear logi : it is not enough to say yes or no, you must
say how muh. See (Girard, 1989b) or (Girard, 1995b) for basi examples.
The refusal of weakening and ontration is basially that two uses are not one use, and that
no use is not use. The tendeny of ludis (and of geometry of interation) is to interpret the
Jean-Yves Girard 154
refusal of weakening and ontration by loative onstraints.

 Saaty volume
Heyting's semantis of proofs interprets a proof of an impliation A ) B as a funtion f
from proofs of A to proofs of B. But how do we know that suh a would-be funtion atually
does the job ? Kreisel (Kreisel, 1965) proposed to add a seond datum, namely A a proof
that the funtion does the job in a xed formal system B. The same sort of twist is used
in the reetion shema, but here Kreisel missed the point. No output at all, only endless
quarrels
88
, as to the orthodoxy of this idea w.r.t. Brouwer, the reative subjet. . . As we see
in ludis with the denition of P, Heyting's denition works without any additional ontrol.
Whether it yields ompleteness or not has nothing to do with odings and other ats of will,
it is deeply rooted in the struture of biorthogonality, i.e., the existene of a omplete ethis.

semantis, Realisability, Reetion shema.
 Savoir-vivre
Personally, I am not very exited by the theorems of ategory-theory ; when I try to apply
one of them in a onrete ase, it is simpler to make a diret proof. But is it the point,
i.e., are we seeking ompliated theorems or are we seeking harmony ? To my opinion,
ategory-theory is the best shool of soialisation, the savoir-vivre of the onepts, think for
instane of pull-baks : there are those who heard about pull-baks and an use them, and
the others. . . The limitations of ategories are the same as those of savoir-vivre, i.e., the real
good manners are without ostentation.
See : Category, Harmony, Obfusation, Pull-bak.
 Shizophrenia
This is the only expression whih applies to the exlusive habit of logiians who present
their systems in two steps, rst the syntax, then the semantis, or vie-versa. This reminds
of those manias who buy books by pairs as if they were soks. . . This is very onvenient,
sine junk syntax an be explained by garbage semantis, and onversely garbage semantis
nds its interest beause of the existene of junk syntax.
It seems possible at least ludis is pushing very hard in that diretion to speak of logi
as a single ativity. Other branhes of mathematis dene their objet in a straight way,
whih does not make them less suessful than logi.

 Sholastis
Medieval sholastis used to interpret syllogisms by other syllogisms, so that Disamis ould
interpret Celarent and vie versa : this explanation has been thought of as ridiulous mainly
beause of the slerosis of the philosophial tradition, at least in logi. But this is denitely
more demanding than the Tarskian tradition whih interprets Barbara A Every A is B, every
B is C, hene every A is C B by the transitivity of inlusion : A  B;B  C ) A  C.
This is a nonsense, sine Barbara is presumably more basi that transitivity of inlusion,
and Tarskian semantis eventually appears as it is : the real sholastis in the aeptation

It is impossible to onvey the atmosphere of dogmatism, mutual exommuniations. . . in name of a rather

 Siene
An ativity that does not deal with reality, in ontrast to tehniques suh as mediine. It is
of ourse better when siene is vaguely related to some external phenomenon, but not that
muh is needed. Wrong sienes, phlogistis, non-monotoni logis, are not wrong beause
they don't apply : simply beause they are ridiulous from the internal viewpoint.
See : Mediine, Non-monotoni logis, Realism.
 Sott domain
Sott domains (Sott, 1976) and the ontemporary f -spaes of Ershov were the rst step
around 1969 in the diretion of an autonomous explanation of logi. Sott onstruted
a ategory of topologial spaes in whih the anonial maps (espeially the ones onerned
with the funtion spae) were ontinuous. What to say about this ? The topologial ontents
is bleak, sine, in order to ope with the dilemma uniform/pointwise, the spaes are only
T
0
, and a funtion in two arguments is ontinuous when separately ontinuous. But the real
drawbak was the overlooking of pull-baks. . . think of A parallel or B of Plotkin.

 Self-interpreter
An
89
interpreter is a program (written in a programming language I) for exeuting other
programs (written in a programming language E). It an thus be used to dene the pro-
gramming language E , e.g., as an exeutable speiation. I is then the dening language
while E is the dened language.
In a self-interpreter, dening language and dened language are the same, and therefore,
a self-interpreter an exeute (a opy of) itself. For example, the programming language
LISP was rst speied with a self-interpreterwhih atually did muh harm to the rep-
utation of LISP, beause this interpreter eliited a debate very similar to the one about
Tarski's denition of truth in logi (Stoy, 1977, pp. 181-182). And indeed, as Reynolds
pointed out (Reynolds, 1998), in a self-interpreter in diret style where literals are dened
as literals, funtions as funtions, appliations as appliations, et., the evaluation order of
the dening language determines the evaluation order of the dened language. Reynolds,
however, also pointed out that a self-interpreter in ontinuation-passing style (where the
dening language is thus a sublanguage of the dened language) makes the evaluation order
of the dened language independent of the evaluation order of the dening language, as
formalised in Plotkin's independene theorem (Plotkin, 1975).
In pratie, self-interpreters are used (1) as expressivity tests for the dened language; (2)
as means of language extension, by making the dened language a superset of the dening
language; and (3) for traing and debugging purposes: the interpreter is instrumented to
maintain extra information about the program it exeutes.
A similar situation ours in the area of ompiler onstrution. A ompiler is a program
(written in a programming language I) translating programs (written in a programming
language S) into other programs (written in a programming language T ). If I is a sub-
language of S, then the orresponding ompiler an translate (a opy of) itself.
89
Or meta-irular interpreter, by Olivier Danvy.
Jean-Yves Girard 156
Partial evaluation (Consel and Danvy, 1993) provides yet another example. A partial eval-
uator is a program (written in a programming language I) speialising programs (written
in a programming language S) with respet to part of their input and produing speialised
programs (written in a programming language T ). Usually, S and T are the same language.
For example, Kleene's S
m
n
-funtion (Kleene, 1952) is a primitive (i.e., non-optimising) partial
evaluator. If I is a sub-language of S, then the orresponding partial evaluator an speialise
(a opy of) itself with respet to a program, yielding a speialiser dediated to this program.
Partial evaluation niely onnets interpreters and ompilers if one onsiders that a program
omputes a funtion from its input to its output: speialising an interpreter with respet
to a program has the eet of translating this program from the dened language to the
dening language. Therefore a ompiled program is a speialised version of an interpreter
and a ompiler is a partial evaluator that has been speialised with respet to an interpreter.
For example, the translation assoiated to a self-interpreter in diret style is the identity
translation
90
. For another example, the translation assoiated to a self-interpreter written
in ontinuation-passing style (CPS) is a CPS transformation.
Overall, a omputer system is onstruted indutively as a (nite) tower of interpreters, from
the miro-ode all the way to the graphial user interfae. Compilers and partial evaluators
were invented to ollapse interpretive levels beause too many levels make a omputer system
impratiably slow. The onept of meta levels therefore is fored on omputer sientists :
I annot make my program work, but maybe the bug is in the ompiler ? Or is it in the
ompiler that ompiled the ompiler ? Maybe the misbehaviour is due to a system upgrade?
Do we need to reboot ? Et. Most of the time, this kind of oneptual regression is daunting
even though it is rooted in the history of the system at hand and thus neessarily nite.

phrases, Reetion shema, Tarski.
 Semantis
From the Greek ~, semantis interprets signs. Neromany, numerology. . . are therefore
part of semantis. The best known form of semantis is due to La Palie and Tarski. Very
often semantis takes the form of gestiulation, i.e., giving sense just for the sake of giving
sense, e.g., in Brooli logis. But the very sense of semantis is to be found in treason, i.e.,
in devious interpretations, suh as interpreting Talibans by students.
I oneived ludis as the semantis of syntax-as-syntax, but soon realised that the word 
like A dialetis B onveys so many impliit meanings adverse to its expliit reading, that
I deided to shun this expression. In order to style ludis as semantis, I would need half
a dozen adjetives like natural, geometrial, monist. . . and anyway the word would always
suggest the existene of some lurking syntax.

 Sense of rules
Proof-searh, proof-normalisation, the atual proess of thinking, they are all direted from
onlusion to premise. For instane I want to prove B, and I gure out a plausible lemma A
whih entails B and then I try to prove A, et. This just means that impliation works in the
diretion opposite to what the arrow suggests. But when the rule is eventually written, it is

As suh, a self-interpreter does not dene very muh indeed, but, as Jones points out, it is useful as an
optimality test for a partial evaluator.

See : Abdution, Formal, Lemma, Proof-searh, Stream.
 Separation
This is a topologial problem : an we separate points ? If two points belong to exatly the
same topologial artifats, then they an be identied without remorse. When this is not
the ase, this means that the preorder
x  y , y  x (219)
is atually an order, i.e., is antisymmetri. This is the weakest possible form of separation :
in ase, the topology is styled T
o
A There is a neighbourhood of x not ontaining y or a
neighbourhood of y not ontaining x B.
A stronger form of separation is to require every point to be losed, or equivalently the
existene of both a neighbourhood of x not ontaining y and a neighbourhood of y not
ontaining x. This is the same as requiring the order  to be the equality : suh topologies
are alled T
1
.
Finally, the strongest (and urrent) form of separation is alled T
2
(or Hausdor ) : the two
neighbourhoods don't interset. The topology on Sott domains and the topology on designs
are T
o
. The duality between dessins indues a topology whih is not T

 Sequential algorithm
In
91
(Berry and Curien, 1982) Berry and Curien used the onrete data strutures intro-
dued previously by Kahn and Plotkin for modelling sequentiality at all simple types. The
basi briks are ells whih an be lled by values. As shown by Lamarhe and Curien
(Lamarhe, 1992; Curien, 1994), ells orrespond to opponent moves and values to player
moves in games. Programs (proofs) are interpreted by A sequential algorithms B  or strate-
gies. A higher-order ell embodies a question of the form A what does the program do with
input x? B and a higher-order value is either some output value or a request of the form
A this further portion of the input has to be explored B. By design, sequential algorithms
are thus streamlike. They were turned by Berry and Curien into a programming language
alled CDS, in whih one an program A tasters B that tell apart two programs omputing the
same funtion, but dierently. Sequential algorithms are the rst example of an expliitly
interative omputational model.

A losely related route to higher-order sequentiality had been opened independently by
Kleene (Kleene, 1978), in an attempt at uring syntati aws in his earlier work on higher-
order omputability. Kleene had a nie voabulary, speaking not of moves, ells or values,
but of envelopes being handed to orales. Before his death, Gandy was working along these
lines with his student Pani, trying to apture exatly the denable elements of the model.
Some of their ideas have been parallelled in H

 Sequentiality
In
92
the denotational semantis of programming languages, sequentiality has been intro-
dued independently by Milner (Milner, 1977) and Vuillemin (Vuillemin, 1974). A funtion
is sequential, intuitively, when its omputational proess an be A linearly sheduled B in
time and Gustave funtion is the typial stable but non sequential funtion. Milner and
Vuillemin found a nie haraterisation of this idea for A type 1 B funtions, that is funtions
of type N      N ! N, whih, a posteriori, an be understood in terms of foalisation.
Sequentiality an be extended to the whole hierarhy of simple types using sequential algo-
rithms (or more generally, strategies in games) or strongly stable funtions.

 Shift
In terms of games, this onnetive rst introdued in (Girard, 2000) onsists in adding
an initial dummy move so as to hange polarity. This is for instane the point in Anderssen's
opening at Chess a2-a3 (he didn't want to play White against the notorious Morphy), but
of ourse, after this rst move, you don't get a swapped opy of Chess
93
. The same is
true in ludis, the possibility of a daimon replaing the initial dummy move, makes llG
non isomorphi to G. The shift is onneted with logial time, i.e., hange of polarity.

There are positive Skunks as well, whih are almost as asoial as their negative prototype.

The pamphlet of Sokal & Brimont (Sokal and Brimont, 1999) was a healthy thing in the

but as a real allegory, think of Laan and his notorious (ab)use of knot theory : one om-
parison in this style is ne, two are already too muh,. . . and what to say about those
psyhoanalysts who (tried to) learn knot theory ?
The problem is the lurking positivism at work in this ritiism. It is easy to ath the philoso-
pher, the psyhoanalyst who makes an irrelevant sienti quotation. But what about those
AI people, who, sine 1950, in eah deade (got largely funded for and) predited that in

 Soundness
In the syntax/semantis shizophrenia, soundness is the onverse of ompleteness : A what is
provable is true B. Soundness, whih is not limited by any restrition is one of Tarpeian roks
of Brooli logis : whatever razy interpretation you devise, the free struture made from
syntax will give you ompleteness by standard tehniques, independently of the intrinsi
qualities of your system, think of the pakage Brooli. When one tries to prove soundness,
one may be asked to restrit to strutures enjoying ertain properties whih are so artiial
that only one suh struture an be exhibited : the free struture, i.e., syntax itself.

with types, i.e., logial formulas. Speiations have so far been ombined by means of
spiritual onnetives.

 Spiritism
If you are surprised to hear that spiritism originates in the most stubborn positivism, think
of the A magial B devianes of formalism. Aniway, Allan Karde, the pope of spiritism is
known for his A positive B theory of ghosts.

 Spiritual logi
In other terms, usual logi, whih speaks of some extraneous reality.
See : Category, Connetive, Deloation, Loative logi, Reservoir, Spiritualism.
 Spiritualism
The opposition loative/spiritual appeared during the omposition of this monograph so
as to beome a great divide. Roughly speaking, spirituality is a very important priniple,
whih guarantees modularity e.g., dedutive priniples, and whih is very well expressed
by ategory theory
Everything is up to isomorphism.
For instane in the Hilbert hotel, all rooms are the same, so you annot tell the dierene
between 13; 39; 40. Spiritualism says that mathematis refer to abstrations, invariants et.
The value of this priniple is immense, but it is ompletely wrong. A physial analogy :
when you enter a plane, you are supposed to turn down your ellular phone, beause of
interferenes : that's a smart spiritual move. . . but interferenes do exist it's preisely the
94
For instane : We guarantee that our ar doesn't use fuzzy logi.
LOCUS SOLUM 161
reason behind the interdition ! In the same way spiritualism avoids logial interferenes,
whih does not mean that they don't make sense.
Category-theory is entirely onerned with spiritual operations, and traditional logi too,
although the idea of a spiritual seond-order quantier is almost an oxymoron. Spirituality
indues good properties, typially ompleteness, and although wrong, remains the most im-
portant guideline we an imagine.
However, in real life, interferenes are not always that bad. In the same way, spiritualism
made us onsiderably weaken our logi priniples, sine it was impossible to exploit some-
thing like the identity of objets. Prenex forms, and more generally what I all A shoking
ommutations B are the positive output of loativism.

 Square wheels
The only way to reat to obfusation is to abstrat from petty tehnial details. Let me
tell a story : at the end of a talk about yet-one-more axiomatisation of negation as failure,
I explained to the orator that his system was inonsistent but sine the audiene was
logially illiterate it was easy for him to get the last word : A I say that my axiom system
proves A . . . B and you say it is inonsistent, so it's even better. B If you keep the disussion
on tehnial grounds, only a ouple of persons will understand, no way. But you an try to
transpose :
A Pr. Berlusoni one remarked (Berlusoni, 1992) that lassial wheels are not aerodynami,
and proposed to square them. Somebody objeted that a ar annot move with square
wheels. . . But said Berlusoni, it's even better, no resistane from the air ! B
See : Joke, Metaphor, Negation as failure, Obfusation.
 Stability
The main breakthrough after Sott domains was stability, disovered by Berry (Berry, 1978),
whih is the basi ingredient of the oherent spaes of (Girard, 1987a), leading to linear logi.
The basi novelty was the disovery, besides the usual extensional order of a oarser stable
ordering. The extensional order is deeply linked (at least in spirit, we didn't hek the details)
to our  : ompare
f  g , 8a f(a)  g(a) (221)
with
D  D
0
, 8E  D j E  D
0
j E (222)
Stability (written as f(a \ b) = f(a) \ f(b) as soon as a [ b is a lique), says that, to any
z 2 f(a), we an assoiate a well-dened nite a
0
 a whih is A responsible B for the fat
that z 2 f(a). In other terms, the map z ; a
0
denes an adjoint map, a feedbak. When
these things are put together in the right framework (oherent spaes), this adjoint map is
just ontraposition, i.e., stability leads to linear negation.

 Stoup
In sequent aluli, a spei plae where formulas are baptised. The stoup is a formal ap-
proah to foalisation.
See : Atomi proposition, Foalisation, Sequent alulus.
 Strategy
A design an be viewed as a strategy, provided we remember that we are playing a game by
onsensus. Indeed the strategy is rather the inarnation of the design.
See : Atomi weapon, Behaviour, Design, Consensus, Game semantis, Inarnation.
 Stream
A stream an be seen as an innite sequents of digits whih ome one after the other, with
delays of arbitrary duration, to the extent that we are not sure that the next digit will
eventually arrive. The orret approah to designs is to see them streamlike. In ase of a
positive base, one is expeting a rst ation, preferably proper. As we are waiting, we an
see something like 
 written. Then the answer may ome, either something like A end of
stream B, i.e., z, or more interestingly (; I). In the latter ase, the stream will proeed,
but we must move to one of the f  i; i 2 Ig, and ask for a spei ramiation J , so we
have been replaing  with   i  J , et. If we think of several parallel hannels waiting
for various values of J , we are in fat building a negative rule. When we start, all hannels
display A 
 B, i.e., we start with N = ;, but N keeps growing and growing. In other terms
the streamlike approah is about innite sequenes of designs, inreasing w.r.t. inlusion : a
design is given progressively, one must think of it as A in formation B.
All operations on designs must be ontinuous : this is why normalisation is streamlike, i.e.,
A proeeds from the onlusion B ; this is also why 
 is not a rule. This is not an absolute
novelty in proof-theory, see (Kreisel et al., 1975), see also (Girard, 1987b) where all ut-
elimination is done in this style.
As to the interpretation of streams, proof-normalisation ats as if the proofs were already
there, and only given in small bits, due to our limited buers, and also beause our data
may be reated by normalisation ; proof-searh presents another interpretation, the proof-
searher is the Sibylla, and surely does not know in advane what will be the next ation,
she an for instane toss a oin et.

 Stritness
Category theory provides us with a lot of properties suh as ommutativity, assoiativity,
et., but only up to isomorphism. These isomorphisms are never equalities, and by the way,
the mere idea of equality is foreign to ategories. In ludis, the basi onnetives are strit,
and when they are say ommutative, this means plain equality. These strit onnetives
admit deloated versions, whih are still say again ommutative, but only up to iso-
morphism. Of ourse ategory theory requires more than mere isomorphisms, they must be
anonial . . . Whatever this means, you will agree that the deloation of an equality ould
hardly indue a non-anonial isomorphism.
Phil Sott points out that strit ategories arise from the study of braid groups. . . But I
still think that the emphasis on stritness is one of the major novelties of ludis, whih is
LOCUS SOLUM 163
not primarily a ategory-theoreti approah.
See : Bergen, Category, Commutativity, Connetive, Deloation.
 Strutural rules
The rules of exhange, weakening, ontration, whih maintain lassial sequent alulus.
These rules are problemati to various extents, the most powerful and ritiisable one
being ontration. Linear logi is based on the banishing of weakening and ontration 
whih beome the main logial rules of the onnetive A ? B. Exhange is usually aepted,
but in non-ommutative logi, see (Abrusi and Ruet, 2000).
The notion of a strutural rule does not make sense in the absene of ut-elimination :
for instane, you an add the axiom sheme A  √Ü A 
 A so as to obtain the eets of
ontration, without delaring ontration ! This is the Tarpeian Rok of the bleak area
known as A substrutural logis B (Shroeder-Heister and Do¬≤en, 1993) : these systems usually
don't enjoy ut-elimination. . .
See : Contration, Linear logi, Non-ommutative logi, Substrutural logis, Tartue,
Weakening.
 Subformula property
The rules of sequent alulus all proeed from simple to omplex with the notorious ex-
eption of the ut-rule : this is the point of ut-elimination. In partiular ut-free proofs
of a formula A are entirely irumsribed in the narrow irle of subformulas of A. The
subformula property indues suh a drasti simpliation of proof-searh that proof-searh
beomes if not deidable tratable, this is logi programming.
The subformula property atually states that the possible proofs (ut-free ones, of ourse)
are already A listed somewhere B, i.e., there is no way to add new proofs. This is the sense that
we give to ompleteness, namely that A nothing is missing B. To be more preise, observe that
external ompleteness is traditionally restrited to 
1
formulas, whih is the same as the
domain of validity of the subformula property for Takeuti's onjeture extends the sope
of ut-elimination to seond-order logi, however without keeping the subformula property
outside the lass 
1
.
In system F, urrent data types are enoded by 
1
formulas, e.g., natural numbers by
int = 8X(X ) X) ) (X ) X). The subformula property enables one to haraterise
all losed normal terms of this type : they basially are in a natural orrespondene with
natural numbers, see (Girard et al., 1990). This is why a term of system F of type int) int
indues through normalisation and ut a reursive funtion from N to itself.

quent alulus, System F, Takeuti's onjeture.
 Substrutural logis
The question is to determine whether or not linear logi whih has good properties suh as
ut-elimination, should be styled A substrutural B : yes, linear logi is a substrutural logi,
but a degenerated one.

semantis, Relevane logis, Strutural rules, Tartue.
 Subtyping
If a type is a speiation, it is lear that the same objet may reeive several types :
inlusion between types (subtyping) is a natural operation, see (Abadi and Cardelli, 1996). It
is important to observe that subtyping is plain inlusion and not some form of isomorphism of
Jean-Yves Girard 164
a type into another one. In ludis subtyping orresponds to the inlusion of behaviours ; when
the type inreases the inarnation dereases. See the detailed example of subsetion 4.4.2.
See : Ane logi, Inarnation, Intersetion type, Speiation, Torino Shool, Winning.
 Syllogism
It's one of the purest even if very old reations of the logial tradition, and its father
Aristotle. A syllogism annot be explained by anything, but another syllogism. This was
the ativity, now onsidered as minor, of the sholasti philosophers. An interesting work
of Abrusi (Abrusi, 2000) interprets the medieval gures in terms of linear logi, more
preisely of proof-nets.
See : Aristotle, Linear logi, Proof-net, Sholastis, Trinity.
 Syntax
From the Greek  & , syntax lassies, puts into order et. Observe that all mathematial
ativity eventually ends with syntax, i.e., syntax only interats with syntax. In order to
minimise what ould be arbitrary in a purely internal interpretation, one has introdued
semantis : syntax should orretly maintain semantis. However the development of proof-
theory sine Gentzen shows that syntax has its own regularity, its own immanene not
restrited to mere onsisteny typially Churh-Rosser property, normalisation. Another
style of semantis is therefore neessary, i.e., the study of syntax as syntax, and not of syntax
as speaking of the world. But the tendeny of these seond-generation semantis typially
denotational semantis is to beome another form of reality, maybe subtler.
Eventually ludis refused the distintion syntax/semantis, by produing artifats (designs,
behaviours) in-between: from syntax it keeps dynamis, nitism (expressed through stream-
like aspets), but rejets bureauray, odings et. From semantis it keeps the idea of
objetivity, plain set-theoreti denitions and geometrial intuitions ; it rejets any form of
gestiulation.
Of ourse when I rejet syntax, I only rejet it as an important philosophial ategory. Pra-
tially speaking, syntax an be extremely important. The building of a useful syntax for
ludis is a very interesting pratial question.

 Syntheti onnetive
It seems that any formula (P;Q;R; : : :) denes a onnetive, but this works only when
there is no hange of polarity inside the formula. Typially A(B
C) denes a onnetive,
whereas A (B&C) doesn't : it is not possible to write omplete rules for that onnetive.
Logial time orresponds to the neessary alternation of syntheti onnetives.

 System F
My rst work in logi (Girard, 1971) is a typed -alulus, extending the Dialetia interpre-
tation to full seond-order, but better known for the denite solution to Takeuti's onjeture.
The very struture of system F is still present in ludis, e.g., in the soundness theorem.

 Tarskian semantis
This is a theory of truth :
F A ^B is true when A is true and B is true.
F A _B is true when A is true or B is true.
F :A is true when A is not true.
F 8xA[x‚ÑÑ is true when A[‚ÑÑ is true for all .
and so on. . . In other terms, truth is the quality of what is true. The rst time one hears
this nonsense, one nds it stupid, but after one learns about a subtle point, namely the
distintion between ^ and and : A you know, and is meta B ; the truth of A is no longer A, it
is in fat meta-A. Tarskian semantis is exiting like a arrot diet. . . But after a few weeks
of suh a diet, nothing tastes better than a arrot : you get addited, and you dispraise
the vulgar minds that say that the King is naked. . . Tarski's semantis represents the most
unimaginative expression of Western rationalism, in sharp ontrast to Brouwer's approah.
The usual shizophreni presentation of logi must be asribed to his inuene.

 Tartuffe
The inredible suess of sequent alulus an be measured by the fashion to formulate junk
logi (without ut-elimination) in sequent alulus. The authors forget (or rather know too
well) that the heavy straightjaket of sequent alulus is only justied by this beautiful re-
ward, ut-elimination. The austerity of the style impliitly suggests ut-elimination, without
stating it, so no possible omplain. This sort of attitude is reminisent of Moli√®re's Tartue,
a rook disguised as a monk.

is a seretion of loks.

 Tensor produt
In ase of overbooking at the Hilbert hotel one group reserving rooms 1; 12; 13, the other
reserving rooms 7; 13; 21 ludis onsiders four loative protools :
D< E : Rooms 7; 13; 21 are given to E, and D gets 1; 12.
Jean-Yves Girard 166
D= E : Rooms 7; 21 are given to E, and D gets 1; 12; 13.
D E : Due to the onit on room 13, the hotel is losed.
D: E : Rooms 7; 21 are given to E, and D gets 1; 12 ; room 13 beomes a ommon room,
and by the way, the hotel keeper installs the most generi inhabitant, the Skunk.
Of ourse, these four protools dier only in the maintenane of the disputed room 13. When
there is no onit, the four denitions ollapse into a single ase, the tensor produt D
 E ,
what an be for instane ahieved with deloation. . . but nobody will get the beautiful room
13.
These four tensors are assoiative, but this is not the point : they do have adjoints, respe-
tively F[A‚ÑÑ; [A‚ÑÑF; (F)A; fFgA. This is why the behaviours onstruted from the four protools
are assoiative.

 Test
How an we hange the plain realisability into an interative version ? The answer is simple,
just say that ar A exatly when a passes a ertain number of tests.
Impliation : In order to test that f r A) B I must produe a realiser ar A, together
with a test  for B : f(a) must pass the test . In other terms a test for A ) B is the
pair of a realiser for A and a test for B.
Conjuntion : If I want to test a would-be realiser  = (
1
; 
2
) of A ^ B, I an either
test the rst omponent, or test the seond omponent. I onlude that a test for A ^B
is a test for A or a test for B. Observe that the notion of test is subtler than the lassial
notion of refutation (ounter-model) : a ounter-model refutes A or B, i.e., may refute
both, whereas the test attaks A (left) or B (right), but not both of them. . . In partiular
a test for A^A is a pair (; i), where  is a test for A to be applied against 
1
 if i = 1,
against 
2
 if i = 2.
Disjuntion : If I want to test a would-be realiser i   of A _ B, I have to prepare two
tests, one in ase () pretends to realise A (i = 1) one in ase it pretends to realise B
(i = 2) : a test for A _ B is therefore a pair (
1
; 
2
) of a test for A and a test for B .
We an summarise our analysis by means of the (temporary) symbol A
t
for tests on A :
(A ^B)

= A
t
_B
t
(A _ B)
t
= A
t
^ B
t

and these formulas are reminisent of the familiar De Morgan laws of lassial logi :
:(A ^ B) = :A _ :B :(A _ B) = :A ^ :B :(A) B) = A ^ :B (224)
This analogy suggest an identiation between A
t
and :A, together with a duality based
on the analogy :
Test for A  Realiser for :A.
In fat this does not work, sine two readings of ^ are ompeting, and only linear logi
an separate them. Eventually everything is xed I mean looks plausible when the

 Time in logi
The intrinsi temporality of logi lies in the study of permutations of rules. Now a luster of
rules of the same polarity an be performed as a single rule, by invertibility in the negative
ase, by foalisation in the positive ase. This is still true of a positive luster followed by
a negative luster, but not the other way around. By symmetry we must onsider that the
intrinsi lok of logi is the hange of polarity (our onnetive l).
Conretely speaking, a double tensor produt A 
 (B 
 C) an be onsidered as a single
ternary onnetive. But a onnetive like A P (B 
C), whih involves a hange of polarity,
annot reeive sequential (i.e., timable) rules, in other terms it is not syntheti. To see this,

In other terms, the only ompound formulas that dene (syntheti) onnetives are those
without hange of polarity.

 To know not and not to know
The basi distintion oming from inompleteness, undeidability. This distintion is negated
by paralogis and metaphors like the story of the prisoners.
The dierene between to-know-not and not-to-know is preisely the dierene between a
negative information and the absene of positive information, i.e., the dierene between

besides logi, for want of a lear status, typially the absene of ategorial semantis et. Lu-

 Trinity
A ^ B is true when A is true and B is true. ^ is the Syntax, A and B is the semantis, and
sine you ould imagine that there is nothing in this denition, omes the Meta : and is
not quite ^ it is meta-^. . . Just like the Christian God omes as three-in-one, Logi has its
own Trinity, namely Semantis (the Father), Syntax (the Son or Verb) and Meta (the Holy
Ghost). Many logial papers look like a religious servie.
See : Blak Mass, Completeness (external), Jurassi Park, Meta, Shizophrenia, Syn-
tax, Semantis.
 Truism
Aording to Tarski, A true B is the essene of truth. And vie-versa truth is the quality of
what is true.
See : La Palie, Pleonasm, Tarskian semantis, Truth.
 Truth
Usually dened by referene to an external preexisting reality. But the truth of A turns
out to be A, and we need all the perversity of Metatarski to get something about it. In the
twenties, people had a nie denition of truth, namely A is true when it is formally provable.
And when G√∂del realised that he ould formalise this notion in arithmeti, no doubt that
he attempted at proving a ontradition, by means of a mere imitation of Cantor's diagonal
argument. By the way he sueeded, but this was not a ontradition, just the fat that
truth ould not be dened that way, in other terms inompleteness.
However I think that this idea of the twenties is orret, provided we replae A formal prov-
ability B whih refers to something too narrowsyntax with provability, but not in a given
system, but in a system that we don't yet know, i.e., in an expanding formalism. Of ourse,
the expansion ould turn badly, and we have to nd some guidelines ; onsisteny the poor
man's immanene is denitely not enough, something as strong as ut-elimination should
be required. It is impossible to desribe this expanding formalism, and surely the old-style
A Panzerdivisionen of theories B miss the point. Behaviours, dened by orthogonality, are
ompletely alien to all the reursive pathologies of the progressions of our (grand-)fathers.

So a formal proof is dened as an inhabitant of a behaviour. However one should pay atten-
tion and not admit any design to the status of would-be formal proof, this is the point of
winning. A behaviour is true when it harbours a winning design, false when its negation is
true. In partiular a behaviour an be neither true nor false.
Although I dene truth in this text, moreover internally, I onsider it as a way of speaking :
truth is no more a true notion than reality is real.

 Twins
Are twins distint persons or distint ourrenes of the same guy ? Who professes the latter
opinion is likely to be kiked in the ass two kiks, not two ourrenes of the same kik.
See : Atomi proposition, Deloation, Fax, Identity axiom, Ourrene.
 Type
If designs were just old -terms then the only possibility would be to dene a behaviour as
a set of designs, and this sort of denition would leave an inredible freedom to the referee,
with the result that not a single non-trivial result on behaviours ould be stated. But what
is a logial formula, or better, a type ? When I give type A to a design D, I mean that as
long as I follow the typing rules everything will work niely : in partiular if A is B √ÜB
0
that D applied to any E of type B yields through normalisation a design (D)E of type B
0
.
The most important thing is not that (D)E is of the right type, but that it has a normal
form. For if B
0
= C  √ÜC
0
we an in turn analyse the property that (D)E is of type B
0
, and
we see that we are bound to look at all ((D)E)F et. We are trying to feed D with all its
arguments. This is not possible usually, but imagine that we an atually reah the point
where all arguments have been given, then we should understand the ultimate mystery of
typing. Tehnially speaking, the only property that all appliations (: : : (D)E
1
: : :)E
n
share
is the existene of a normal form. So let us use our linear logi bakground, and write A as
A
0
 √Ü ?, where A
0
is the type orresponding to the negation of A : the ondition ensures
that, given E in A
0
whatever this means D?E, and nothing more. Hene if I ll the
type A with all designs in A
0?
, then this bigger type will enjoy all onstraints already
satised by A. Sine nature abhors a vauum, we must onsider that A
0?
is the real type.
Conretely this mean that eah type is the orthogonal of something (a set of designs, seen
as onstraints), and using the ommon bakground of elementary mathematis that a
type is a set of designs equal to its biorthogonal. By the way this fores A
0
= A
?
, what the
notation was heavily suggesting anyway.
See : Behaviour, Design, Orthogonality, Referee.
 Unbounded operator
In funtional analysis, an unbounded operator is a partial operator whose graph is losed.
By the losed graph theorem, if the operator happens to be total, it beomes an ordi-
nary (bounded) operator. In partiular, a really unbounded operator i.e., whose norm is
innite is partial, not out of a forgotten totality, but intrinsially.
See : G√∂del's inompleteness, Halting problem, Paralogis.
 Unfalsifiable
Very reently (Marh 2000) I got a opy of an Email from a professional AI man, who was
so happy, so happy, he ould not help it. . . to learn that G√∂del's theorem had eventually
been shown wrong. Of ourse mathematis were immediately inonsistent beause of this
Jean-Yves Girard 170
disovery. . . The poor hap didn't notie that G√∂del's theorem annot be disproved, sine
it is stated as A If Peano's arithmetiis onsistent, then. . . B.
There is a big dierene between a refutation of Fermat and a refutation of G√∂del : in both
ases mathematis beome inonsistent for these theorems have been proven. But Fermat's
theorem beomes denitely wrong, whereas G√∂del's theorem is proved on even more solid
grounds. This is the example of an unfalsiable result, and, aording to Pauperism of no
sienti value. But maybe, it's Pauperism whih has no value at all. . .

 Uniformity
This winning ondition expresses alikeness, e.g., invariane under permutation. The subtle
point is that uniformity relies on non-uniform objets, just like virtue relies on sinners.
See : Barbihette, Bihaviour, Dog, First-order quantier, La√ºhli semantis, Loser,

 Variables
This is the typial loative artifat, ompletely mistreated by the logial tradition. The
Tarskian redo says that a variable refers to some objet, whereas it is only a loation 
typially the loation of its binder. Computer sientists were more perspiuous than logiians,
sine they spent a lot of energy on the problem of renaming variables, think of De Bruijn
indies : in omputer siene, a variable is an address in the memory, and no spiritual
priniple an make two addresses equivalent (even if some ommands like defrag are of
spiritual nature, and the user interfaes try to minimise the alloation problems). The typial
interferene of variables is known as apture, see the dierene between
P
i
a

:b

et
P

j

.
The renaming of i into j avoids an interferene.
The theory of free and bound variables is still a typial topi for the early morning leture the
day just after a meeting banquet. But this is a deep subjet, provided one aepts apture
as a natural phenomenon like interferene. By the way interferene ours in a omputer.

disjuntion is not a lassial onjuntion with a hand in the bak, it is a dierent operation.
By the way, loative phenomenons show that these non-lassial onnetives are no longer
bound to be weaker than the A orresponding B lassial ones, whih, by the way, stop to be
A orresponding B at all, think of equation (100).

Winning
A behaviour is as we said the ludi equivalent of a formula. In logi formulas are valid
i.e., assuming external ompleteness provable or not, but it is never the ase that both
G;G
?
are valid. How an we speak of validity, i.e., truth of a behaviour ? If truth is 
by analogy with ompleteness the existene of a proof, then the truth of a behaviour is
something like the existene of a design in the behaviour. . . But unfortunately behaviours
are never empty. Hene the idea is to distinguish between rst and seond-lass itizens
among designs. First-lass designs will be styled winning, whih orresponds, in dereasing
order of importane to being uniform, stubborn and parsimoniouswhat a program indeed !
Now let us go to subtle points :
F Winning must be introspetive : just beause the output of an interation annot be
analysed. Hene winning should be a general property of designs. A typial want of taste
would be to introdue A andidates of winning B, by saying that a behaviour is given
by means of a set of designs together with a distinguished subset (likely to be empty),
the winning ones ; this style of extrospetive denition would be a major aw in the
onstrution, a hidden way to reintrodue the referee.
In fat, subtyping whih is inlusion between behaviours G  H impliitly requires that
a design whih is winning in G must remain winning in H. . . and the logial relation
style is inompatible with suh a brutal simpliity.
F In a behaviour, a design should be replaeable by its inarnation. If the design is winning,
so should be the inarnation. The only way to ensure this property is to require that the
winning of E implies the winning of D as soon as D  E.
F The logial relation style A F of type G √ÜH is winning i for all winning A 2 G, the
design (F)A is winning B is forbidden. However, it will be true that if F;A are winning,
(F)A is winning. To sum up, winning is losed under normalisation, i.e., a net formed
with winning designs must normalise into a winning net. . . provided it normalises.
F Finally not every design should be winning. Typially, it should not be possible to nd
D 2G and E 2G
?
, both winning. It this were the ase, then the normal form Dai of the
net fD;Eg would be winning too. Hene the simplest is to require daimons to be losing,
whih is ensured by obstination.

 Xenoglossy
I found this rather artiial word whih refers to a medium speaking a language that he
does not understand to stress a methodologial point that will be my onlusion, namely
the importane of the raks in the building.
The expliit aim of the ludi programme is to give the interpretation of logi, not yet-one-
more semantis, natural or not. Where to nd the right ideas ? Surely not in our intentions,
basi intuitions, even if they are pure : plenty of people had the same and didn't make it.
The methodology I use is to start with something rather standard, whih has proven to be
useful, and to examine the leakage, preferably the small leakage : this is the rak in the
building, the building must be safe and the rak almost invisible. You may say that I am
telling trivialities. . . But think twie and look at the tendeny of authors to minimise their
(small) failures, by tampering with denitions.
One the small rak has been identied, one should try to enlarge it ; it is most likely that
some interesting animal lives there. To be onrete, let me take a ouple of examples from
my personal experiene :
F Sott semantis was in its day a remarkable ahievement. I one remarked that Sott
domains are not diret limits of nite ones ; this small rak that some authors lled
by styling nite a nitely generated Sott domain eventually led to the disovery of
oherent spaes.
F The interpretation of intuitionisti logi in oherent spaes worked smoothly, but for the
intuitionisti disjuntion : given stable maps F from X to Z and G from Y to Z, the
union F [G does not dene a stable map from X + Y to Z, sine F (;) may dier from
G(;). This small rak an be xed by some ompliation of the denition, e.g., replaing
oherent spaes with A dI domains B. By stiking to oherent spaes I was led to use a
linearisation tehnique, the key to linear logi.
F Full ompleteness theorems work with a limited amount of leakage, provided one exludes
the additive neutrals : they are assoiated with A zero spaes B whih make the interpre-
tation ollapse. This is why additive neutrals are absent from all works onerned with
full ompleteness. I realised that this problem had to be solved anyway. . . The answer
led to the reognition of polarity as the major divide of logi, and to ludis.
F Of ourse, some raks didn't reveal anything, e.g., the leakage of proof-nets w.r.t. mul-
tipliative neutrals was to omplex to lead to anything.
The problem is to go on, and to know what to do in say the deliate problem of exponen-
tials. A few months ago, instead of hapter 7, there was a hapter about exponentials and
it worked ! Yes it worked, but not with the miraulous adequation between onepts that you
an nd in the present manusript. Hene I deided that I had not understood something,
and removed the hapter from the nal version. Something is missing, but exponentials form
a too big problem to be diretly attaked within a reasonable time.
Fortunately, ludis, as it is, is not perfet even if more satisfatory than any previous
explanation. There is even one small rak, namely the mismath between parsimony and
exatness. Remember that I proved full ompleteness w.r.t. exatness, but that I onsider
parsimony as the right notion, sine exatness is not interative. All extant full omplete-
ness results are based on non-interative denitions, e.g., some external uniformity ; hene
why not hanging my denitions and all A winning B a strategy that omes from an exat
design ? Just beause it would refer to some A moral B priniple (exatness), whih an lead
to Tarskian regressions. Something is winning when it wins all partiular plays (disputes),
LOCUS SOLUM 173
period. Changing the denition of winning from parsimonious to exat is typial of a men-
tality of bounty hunter that I onsider adverse to siene.
We are left with two possible senarii :
Pessimisti version : Parsimony annot make its way. I am sorry, but then we should
aept weakening as a orret logial priniple, whether we like it or not.
Optimisti version : Parsimony is the same as exatness, provided the notion of design
is liberalised. This liberalisation onsists in proving a strengthened form of separation :
If D 2 G
p
is nite and material, then there exists E 2 G
?
suh that the
normalisation of fD;Eg onsumes exatly D.
Moreover the main highways, stability, assoiativity, et. should remain.
I do believe on the optimisti senario, and I started to work on it. This global onsumption
requires both a desequentialisation of designs several ations in parallel and a possibility
of reuse of foi whih will produe superimpositions up to non-determinism. Then the
requirement of stability should involve the use of real oeients, leading to a probabilisti
approah, or to a new version of GoI. . .

The essential designs-dessins have been listed below, with depending on their polarity
positive or negative logos.
FAITH
Figure 1. Fid


` 
Fid is not a design, sine it denotes the absene of design, in general due to
the divergene of normalisation. Fid is a partial design, indeed the only quite
partial design of a given base.
