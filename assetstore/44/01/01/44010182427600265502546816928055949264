Abstract—Genome rearrangement is an important area in computational biology and bioinformatics. The translocation operation
is one of the popular operations for genome rearrangement. It was proved that computing the unsigned translocation distance is
NP-hard. In this paper, we present a ð1:5þ Þ-approximation algorithm for computing the unsigned translocation distance that
improves upon the best known 1.75-ratio. The runtime of our algorithm is Oðn2 þ ð4Þ1:5

1 INTRODUCTION
WITH the development of fast sequencing techniques,large-scale DNA molecules are investigated with
respect to the relative order of genes in them. Contrary to
the traditional alignment approach, genome rearrange-
ments are based on the comparison of gene orders and
the evolution of gene families. Genome rearrangement has
become an important area in computational biology and
bioinformatics. Although the rearrangement is very com-
plicated, there are three basic operations for genome
rearrangement: reversal, translocation, and transposition.
Hannenhalli and Pevzner gave the first polynomial time
algorithm for the signed reversal distance problem [6].
A chromosome X ¼ x1; x2; . . . ; xp is a sequence of genes,
where each gene xi is represented by an integer. A gene xi
has a direction. We use a signed integer to represent a
directed gene and use an unsigned integer to represent a
gene with unknown direction. Throughout this paper, each
xi in a signed chromosome is a signed integer, and each xi in
an unsigned chromosome is an unsigned integer. A signed
genome is a set of signed chromosomes, and an unsigned
genome is a set of unsigned chromosomes. We assume that
each gene appears exactly once in a genome. Here, the
orders of genes in chromosomes matter, and the order of
chromosomes in the genome does not matter.
For two unsigned chromosomes X ¼ x1; x2; . . . ; xm and
Y ¼ y1; y2; . . . ; yn in a genome, a translocation swaps the
segments in the chromosomes and generates two new
chromosomes. If we cut X at gene xið1 < i  mÞ and cut Y
at gene yjð1 < j  nÞ, we can have one of the following two
sets of new chromosomes:
. Set 1 : x1; . . . ; xi1, yj; . . . ; yn and y1; . . . ; yj1,
xi; . . . ; xm.
. Set 2: x1; . . . ; xi1, yj1; . . . ; y1 and yn; . . . ; yj,
xi; . . . ; xm.
This implies that we can treat each unsigned chromosome Y
in two ways, Y ¼ y1; y2; . . . ; yn or Y ¼ yn; yn1; . . . ; y2; y1.
For two signed chromosomes X ¼ x1; x2; . . . ; xm and Y ¼
y1; y2; . . . ; yn in a genome, a translocation cutting at gene
xið1 < i  mÞ and gene yjð1 < j  nÞ leads to one of the
following two sets of chromosomes:
. S e t 1 : x1; . . . ; xi1, yj; . . . ; yn and y1; . . . ; yj1,
xi; . . . ; xm.
. Set 2: x1; . . . ; xi1, yj1; . . . ;y1 and yn; . . . ;yj,
xi; . . . ; xm.
Again, we can treat each signed chromosome Y in two
ways, Y ¼ y1; y2; . . . ; yn or Y ¼ yn;yn1; . . . ;y2;y1.
Here, none of the four segments cut by the translocation
operation is empty. Throughout this paper, we work on this
restricted version. The translocation distance between two
(signed/unsigned) genomes is the minimum number of
translocations used to transform one genome into the other.
We use dsðA;BÞ and dðA;BÞ to represent the signed
translocation distance and unsigned translocation distance,
respectively.
The signed translocation problem was first studied in
[7]. Lots of algorithms have been developed since then [5],
[10], [1]. Recently, Ozery-Flato and Shamir gave an
Oðn3=2 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffilogðnÞp Þ algorithm in [9]. The translocation distance
computation for unsigned genomes was first studied by
Kececioglu and Ravi [7]. The problem was proved to be
NP-hard by Zhu and Wang in [11]. Kececioglu and Ravi
gave a ratio-2 approximation algorithm for computing the
translocation distance of unsigned genomes [7]. Cui et al.
gave a ratio -1.75 approximation algorithm [4].
In this paper, we present a ratio-1:5þ  approximation
algorithm for computing the translocation distance of
unsigned genomes, where  > 0 is any constant. For ratio
1:5þ , our algorithm runs in Oðn2 þ ð4Þ1:5

 is less than
9,000,000 and takes a few seconds on a PC. Similar to the
ratio-1.75 approximation algorithm, the basic idea is to
design a cycle decomposition algorithm to give a sign to
each gene and then compute the signed distance.
The new ideas. We show in Section 3 that to achieve
ratio 1:5þ , we have to look after the number of 2-cycles cA2
and the number of a special kind of minimal subpermuta-
tions (minSPs), the 1 2 minSPs, sA2 in the cycle decom-
position algorithm. (See Lemma 4.) In our new algorithm,
we remove all RS-MSPs (a special kind of 1 2minSPs). In
the process, we can always ensure that when sA2 is reduced
by one, cA2 is reduced by at most one. In many cases, when
sA2 is reduced, c
A
2 is not reduced. Thus, the value of c
A
2  sA2
in our new algorithm is greater than that in the ratio -1.75
algorithm. Therefore, we can get a better ratio based on
Hannenhalli’s formula in Lemma 2.
2 SIGNED AND UNSIGNED TRANSLOCATION
The unsigned translocation distance can be computed with
three steps: 1) try all possible ways to assign signs to the
genes, 2) compute the distance for the pair of signed
genomes, and 3) choose the minimum distance among all
possible settings of signs. To design approximation algo-
rithms, we actually design approximation algorithms to
assign signs to genes. First, let us review the computation
method for signed genomes that was originally created by
Hannenhalli [5].
2.1 Signed Translocation
Given signed genomes A and B, the breakpoint graph
GsðA;BÞ can be obtained as follows: For every chromo-
some X ¼ x1; x2; . . . ; xn of A, replace each xi with an
ordered pair ðlðxiÞ; rðxiÞÞ of vertices. If xi is positive,
then ðlðxiÞ; rðxiÞÞ ¼ ðxti; xhi Þ; if xi is negative, then
ðlðxiÞ; rðxiÞÞ ¼ ðxhi ; xtiÞ. The vertices (genes) rðxiÞ and
lðxiþ1Þ (xi and xiþ1) are neighbors in A. The neighbors
in B are defined analogously. For two vertices u and v,
if they are neighbors in A, then we use a black edge to
connect them; if they are neighbors in B, then we use a
gray edge to connect them.
Example 1. Let the two genomes be
A ¼ fð1; 2; 3Þ; ð4;6;5; 7Þg and B ¼ fð1; 2; 3Þ; ð4; 5; 6; 7Þg:
Both A and B contain two chromosomes. See Fig. 1a.
Without loss of generality, we assume that each chromo-
some in B is a segment of consecutive positive integers, for
example, i; iþ 1; iþ 2; . . . ; j 1; j. Every vertex (except the
ones at the two ends of a chromosome) in GsðA;BÞ is
incident with one black and one gray edge. Therefore,
GsðA;BÞ can be uniquely decomposed into cycles. A cycle
containing exactly i black (gray) edges is called an i-cycle. A
cycle is long if it is not a 1-cycle.
Let X ¼ x1; x2; . . . ; xp be a chromosome in A. A sub-
permutation ðSP Þ is an interval xi; xiþ1; . . . ; xiþl in X
containing at least three genes such that there is another
interval of the same length yj; yjþ1; . . . ; yjþl in a chromosome
Y of B satisfying
f xij j; xiþ1j j; . . . ; xiþlj jg ¼ f yj
 ; yjþ1 ; . . . ; yjþl g;
xi ¼ yj; xiþl ¼ yjþl;
and the permutation xi; xiþ1; . . . ; xiþl1; xiþl is not identical
to the permutation yj; yjþ1; . . . ; yjþl1; yjþl. Here, xi and xiþl
are the two ending genes of the SP . A minSP is an SP not
containing any other SP . The structure of minSP is defined
as a framed common interval in [2]. The properties of framed
common intervals are used in the analysis of sorting signed
permutations by reversals in [2] and [3]. By the definition of
SP , we have the following lemma, originally in [4]:
Lemma 1 [4]. Let I ¼ xi; xiþ1; . . . ; xj1; xj be an SP in
GsðA;BÞ, then GsðA;BÞ cannot have the gray edge
ðrðxiÞ; lðxjÞÞ.
The translocation distance for signed genomes is closely
related to the number of cycles and the number of minSPs.
If all minSPs in GsðA;BÞ are in an SP , say, I, and the total
number of minSPs is even, then I is an even isolation.
Clearly, there is at most one even isolation in GsðA;BÞ.
Let n be the number of genes and N be the number of
chromosomes for two signed genomes A and B. Let c be the
number of cycles and s be the number of minSPs in
GsðA;BÞ. The remaining index f is defined as follows:
1) f ¼ 1 if s is odd, 2) f ¼ 2 if there is an even isolation, and
3) f ¼ 0 otherwise. Lemma 2, originally in [5], gives the
formula to compute the translocation distance dsðA;BÞ.
Lemma 2 (Hannenhalli’s formula) [5].
dsðA;BÞ ¼ nN  cþ sþ f:
The signed translocation distance can be computed in
Oðn1:5 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffilogðnÞp Þ time [9].
2.2 Unsigned Translocation
Consider unsigned genomes A and B. For every chromo-
some X ¼ x1; x2; . . . ; xn of A, xi and xiþ1 are neighbors in A.
The neighbors in B are defined analogously. To define the
breakpoint graph GðA;BÞ in the unsigned case, we use a
vertex to represent a gene. Two vertices are connected with
a black edge if they are neighbors in A, and two vertices are
connected with a gray edge if they are neighbors in B.
CUI ET AL.: A ð1:5þ Þ-Approximation ALGORITHM FOR UNSIGNED TRANSLOCATION DISTANCE 57
Fig. 1. (a) The breakpoint graph GsðA;BÞ for the signed case,
where A ¼ fð1; 2; 3Þ; ð4;6;5; 7Þg, and B ¼ fð1; 2; 3Þ; ð4; 5; 6; 7Þg.
(b) The breakpoint graph GðA;BÞ for the unsigned case, where
A ¼ fð1; 2; 3Þ; ð4; 6; 5; 7Þg, and B ¼ fð1; 2; 3Þ; ð4; 5; 6; 7Þg.
Example 2. Let the two genomes be
A ¼ fð1; 2; 3Þ; ð4; 6; 5; 7Þg and B ¼ fð1; 2; 3Þ; ð4; 5; 6; 7Þg:
Both A and B contain two chromosomes. See Fig. 1b.
Note that every vertex is incident with either one black
edge and one gray edge or two black edges and two gray
edges. Therefore, the cycle decompositions for GðA;BÞ are
not unique. Once we have a cycle decomposition for the
breakpoint graph of two unsigned genomes, we can get a
unique breakpoint graph of two signed genomes, that is, we
can assign a sign to each gene in the genomes. Without loss
of generality, we assume that all genes in B are positive.
Therefore, all gray edges in the signed breakpoint graph
have the form ðih; ðiþ 1ÞtÞ. Given a cycle decomposition of
the unsigned breakpoint graph, we assign the two ending
genes in each chromosome in A as follows: If the ending
gene is at the left ends or at the right ends in both A and B,
then the gene is positive in A; otherwise, it is negative in A.
A positive gene xi corresponds to a pair of vertices ðxti; xhi Þ,
and a negative gene xi corresponds to a pair of vertices
ðxhi ; xtiÞ. For the rest of the genes xi, we can use the gray
edges ðih; ðiþ 1ÞtÞ (starting with the ending genes) to
determine if gene xi corresponds to the pair of vertices
ðxti; xhi Þ or ðxhi ; xtiÞ. Therefore, we can determine the sign of
xi. Let us look at Fig. 1b. Suppose the cycle decomposition
of the first genome is fð1; 2Þ; ð2; 1Þg and fð2; 3Þ; ð3; 2Þg. The
genes in the chromosome in B are all positive fþ1;þ2;þ3g.
All the ending genes are also positive in A. Therefore,
gene 1 corresponds to ð1t; 1hÞ. In cycle fð1; 2Þ; ð2; 1Þg, the
gray edge ð1h; 2tÞ is connected to the black edge ð2t; 1hÞ.
Thus, gene 2 corresponds to the pair ð2t; 2hÞ, and the sign of
gene 2 should be positive in A.
3 AN EQUIVALENT TARGET FOR OBTAINING
Ratio-1:5þ 
To approximate the translocation distance of the unsigned
genomes A and B, we always compute the cycle decom-
position of GðA;BÞ to get the assignment of signs to A and
B. Let A and B be two unsigned genomes and GðA;BÞ be
the unsigned breakpoint graph. Let Gopts ðA;BÞ be a signed
breakpoint graph corresponding to an optimal (among all
possible ways of assigning signs to genes) cycle decom-
position of GðA;BÞ such that the unsigned distance
dðA;BÞ ¼ nN  copt þ sopt þ fopt, where copt, sopt, and fopt
are the number of cycles, the number of minSPs, and the
remaining index in Gopts ðA;BÞ, respectively. The following
lemma shows that keeping the maximum number of
1-cycles is a good strategy:
Lemma 3. We modify Gopts ðA;BÞ as follows: If two vertices in
GðA;BÞ are connected by a black edge and a gray edge, then
we reassign the signs of the two genes to obtain a 1-cycle.
Assume that c, s, and f are the number of cycles, the
number of minSP s, and the remaining index in the resulting
breakpoint graph GsðA;BÞ, respectively. We have dðA;BÞ ¼
nN  copt þ sopt þ fopt ¼ nN  c þ s þ f.
Proof. Consider two vertices xi and xiþ1 that are neighbors in
both genomes, and xi and xiþ1 are not in a 1-cycle in
Gopts ðA;BÞ. After reassigning the signs of the two genes to
obtain a 1-cycle, we get a new cycle decomposition
G0sðA;BÞ. Let c0, s0, and f 0 be the number of cycles, the
number ofminSPs, and the remaining index inG0sðA;BÞ,
respectively. We will prove that
nN  copt þ sopt þ fopt  nN  c0 þ s0 þ f 0;
that is, G0sðA;BÞ is also an optimal cycle decomposition.
We consider two cases:
1. Only one sign of xi and xiþ1 is changed. Without
loss of generality, assume that the sign of xi is
changed. Figs. 2a and 2e show the breakpoint
graphs before and after changing the sign of xi.
After changing the sign of xi, the black edges
ðrðxi1Þ; lðxiÞÞ and ðrðxiÞ; lðxiþ1ÞÞ are in two differ-
ent cycles. Thus, we have c0 ¼ copt þ 1. Moreover,
the number of minSPs is not changed or is
decreased by one. When the number of minSPs
is not changed, the remaining index is also not
changed. When the number of minSPs is de-
creasedby one, the remaining index is increased by
at most one. Thus, we have sopt þ fopt  s0 þ f 0 and
nN  copt þ sopt þ fopt  nN  c0 þ s0 þ f 0.
2. The signs of both xi and xiþ1 are changed. Since
we have to change the signs of both xi and xiþ1 to
get the 1-cycle, the gray edge ðlðxiÞ; rðxiþ1ÞÞ must
be in Gopts ðA;BÞ. Thus, the two black edges
ðrðxi1Þ; lðxiÞÞ and ðrðxiþ1Þ; lðxiþ2ÞÞ are in one
cycle before changing the signs. Three subcases
arise. (See Figs. 2b, 2c, and 2d.) After changing
signs, we get the breakpoint graphs illustrated in
Figs. 2f, 2g, and 2h, respectively.
In Fig. 2f, the number of cycles are increased by
two, that is, c0 ¼ copt þ 2. The number ofminSPs is

unchanged or is increased by one. If the number of
minSPs is not changed, the remaining index is also
not changed. If the number ofminSPs is increased
by one, the remaining index is increased by atmost
one. Thus, s0 þ f 0  sopt þ fopt þ 2. For the cases
illustrated in Figs. 2g and 2h, we have s0 ¼ sopt and
f 0 ¼ fopt. Obviously, c0  copt. Therefore, nN 
copt þ sopt þ fopt  nN  c0 þ s0 þ f 0 for this case.
If we reassign the signs of genes to get one more
1-cycle, the inequality nN  copt þ sopt þ fopt  n
N  c0 þ s0 þ f 0 always holds. Therefore, the lemma
holds. tu
Let GAs ðA;BÞ be the signed breakpoint graph obtained by
our algorithm. Let cAi be the number of i-cycles, sA the
number of minSPs, and fA the remaining index in
GAs ðA;BÞ. The number of translocations required by the
approximation algorithm is denoted as dAðA;BÞ. By

4 THE APPROXIMATION ALGORITHM
The ratio-1.75 approximation algorithm in [4] can give a
cycle decomposition of the unsigned breakpoint graph that
contains the maximum number of 1-cycles and a big
number of 2-cycles. For our new algorithm, we also need
to do this. Let us first review the ratio-1.75 cycle decom-
position algorithm.
4.1 The Ratio-1.75 Cycle Decomposition Algorithm
To get a cycle decomposition, we keep the maximum
number of 1-cycles. That is, if two vertices are joined by a
black edge and a gray edge in GðA;BÞ (that is, they are
neighbors in both genomes), then assign proper signs to the
two genes to obtain the 1-cycle.
After obtaining the maximum number of 1-cycles, we
want to get 2-cycles as many as possible in polynomial time.
Note that the signs of some genes have been fixed in
order to get the maximum number of 1-cycles. A match
graph FAB of a breakpoint graph GðA;BÞ is defined as
follows: 1) for every black edge in GðA;BÞ with at least one
end not assigned a sign, we create a vertex of FAB , and
2) for every two vertices of FAB (representing two black
edges in GðA;BÞ), we create an edge connecting them in
FAB if the two black edges in GðA;BÞ can form a 2-cycle.
Let M denote a maximum match of FAB . (There may
exist more than one maximum match. Here, any maximum
match will do.) Every edge in M represents a 2-cycle in
GðA;BÞ. By the construction of FAB , two 2-cycles in M
cannot share any black edge of GðA;BÞ. However, they may
share a gray edge in GðA;BÞ. In that case, the two 2-cycles
cannot be kept in the cycle decomposition simultaneously.
A 2-cycle in M is isolated if it does not share any gray edge
with any other 2-cycle. Otherwise, the 2-cycle is related.
Since a 2-cycle has two gray edges, it is related to at most
two 2-cycles.
A related component U consists of related 2-cycles
C1; C2; . . . ; Ck, where Ci is related to Ci1 ð2  i  kÞ, and
every 2-cycle in U is not related to any 2-cycle not in U .
Consider two related 2-cycles Ci and Ci1 sharing a gray
edge. The two cycles Ci and Ci1 also share the genes at the
two ends of the gray edge. Thus, 1) if the two black edges in
Ci are in the same chromosome, then so do the two black
edges in Ci1, and 2) if the two black edges in Ci are in two
chromosomes, then the two black edges in Ci1 are also in
the same two chromosomes. The process can be repeated to
include more cycles. Therefore, a related component
involves at most two chromosomes and can only be one
of the four types shown in Fig. 3.
The ratio-1.75 cycle decomposition algorithm contains
three steps: 1) keep all 1-cycles in the breakpoint graph,
2) keep all the isolated 2-cycles and alternatively select
CUI ET AL.: A ð1:5þ Þ-Approximation ALGORITHM FOR UNSIGNED TRANSLOCATION DISTANCE 59
2-cycles for every related component, and 3) arbitrarily do
the decomposition for the remaining vertices.
In the new ratio-ð1:5þ Þ algorithm, we modify step 2
so that we can remove RS-MSPs (a special kind of
1 2minSPs).
4.2 The RS-MSP
Note that every minSP contains at least one long cycle. A
simpleminSP ðS-MSPÞ is aminSP containing one 2-cycle as
its unique long cycle and containing at least one 1-cycle. The
two gray edges in the 2-cycle must be “twisted” since by
Lemma 1, ðrðxiÞ; lðxjÞÞ cannot be a gray edge for the two
ending genes xi and xj. In Fig. 4a, the segment of genes
xi; . . . ; xj forms a simple minSP .
Let Is ¼ xi; xiþ1; . . . ; xj1; xj be an S-MSP in GsðA;BÞ. A
removable simple minSP ðRS-MSPÞ Is is a simple minSP
such that the two black edges ðrðxi1Þ; lðxiÞÞ and
ðrðxjÞ; lðxjþ1ÞÞ framing Is belong to a twisted cycle and at
least one of the gray edge ðrðxi1Þ; rðxjÞÞ or ðlðxiÞ; lðxjþ1ÞÞ is
in the twisted cycle. The gray edge ðrðxi1Þ; rðxjÞÞ or
ðlðxiÞ; lðxjþ1ÞÞ is the key gray edge of Is. The twisted cycle
is called the removable cycle of Is. Fig. 4a gives an example.
Given unsigned genomes A and B, a candidate removable
simple minSP ðCRS-MSPÞ is defined as an interval Ic ¼
xi; xiþ1; . . . ; xiþl containing at least four genes in a chromo-
some of A such that 1) there is another interval of the same
length yj; yjþ1; . . . ; yjþl in a chromosome Y of B satisfying
xi ¼ yj; xiþl ¼ yjþl and xiþk ¼ yjþlk ð1  k  l 1Þ and 2) at
least one of the gray edges ðxi1; xiþlÞ or ðxi; xiþlþ1Þ exists.
Any CRS-MSP can be turned into an RS-MSP by
1) assigning proper signs to all genes in it to turn it into
an S-MSP and 2) assigning a proper sign to xi1 or xiþlþ1
such that at least one of the key gray edges ðrðxi1Þ; rðxiþlÞÞ
or ðlðxiÞ; lðxiþlþ1ÞÞ is in the signed breakpoint graph. An
RS-MSP also corresponds to a CRS-MSP in the unsigned
breakpoint graph. An RS-MSP is an S-MSP too. For
convenience, we also call the unique 2-cycle in the S-MSP,
the unique 2-cycle in the CRS-MSP.
Lemma 5. Given an RS-MSP Is ¼ xi; xiþ1; . . . ; xj1; xj, if we
change the signs of xi and xj, then we have the following:
1. I1 ¼ xi; xiþ1; . . . ; xj1;xj is no longer a minSP .
2. The number of minSP s is not increased.
3. The number of i-cycles in the new breakpoint graph
remains the same.
Proof. Cases 1 and 2 of Lemma 5 were proved in [4]. Now,
we prove case 3. If Is is an RS-MSP, then GsðA;BÞ
contains at least one of gray edges ðrðxi1Þ; rðxjÞÞ and
ðlðxiÞ; lðxjþ1ÞÞ. Changing the signs of xi and xj creates at
least one of gray edges ðrðxi1Þ; lðxjÞÞ and ðrðxiÞ; lðxjþ1ÞÞ
and creates two new cycles C1 and C2. (See Fig. 4b).
Assume that the removable cycle C is an i-cycle ði  2Þ.
By definition, at least one of the gray edges ðrðxi1Þ; rðxjÞÞ
and ðlðxiÞ; lðxjþ1ÞÞ is in C. Thus, one of C1 and C2 is a
2-cycle, and the other is an i-cycle. (See Figs. 4a and 4b.)
Therefore, case 3 of Lemma 5 holds. tu
4.3 The New Cycle Decomposition Algorithm
There are six steps for the new algorithm. The first two
steps of the new cycle decomposition algorithm are 1) keep
all 1-cycles and 2) compute the maximum match M as
described in Section 4.1.
4.3.1 Creating RS-MSPs
After all 1-cycles are kept in our algorithm, we look for the
isolated 2-cycles in M that can be the unique 2-cycles for
simpleminSPs. The 2-cycle is a twisted 2-cycle such that all
the black edges between the two black edges of the 2-cycle

chromosomes are involved in the component.

are involved in 1-cycles. It is easy to see that it takes at most
Oðn2Þ time to identify all the isolated 2-cycles that can be the
unique 2-cycles of some simple minSPs. Once the unique
2-cycle of a simple minSP is identified, we obtain a simple
minSP .
Let Is ¼ xi; xiþ1; . . . ; xj be a simple minSP . If there is a
gray edge ðxi1; xjÞ or a gray edge ðxi; xjþ1Þ in GðA;BÞ, then
we can certainly create gray edge ðrðxi1Þ; rðxjÞÞ or gray
edge ðlðxiÞ; lðxjþ1ÞÞ in the signed breakpoint graph so that Is
becomes an RS-MSP. However, when creating gray edge
ðrðxi1Þ; rðxjÞÞ or ðlðxiÞ; lðxjþ1ÞÞ, some 2-cycles in M might
be destroyed. For example, if ðlðxiÞ; lðxjþ1ÞÞ is created in the
breakpoint graph, then the two 2-cycles C1 and C2 in Fig. 5a
cannot be kept in the same breakpoint graph anymore.
Similarly, if ðrðxi1Þ; rðxjÞÞ is created, then the two 2-cycles
C1 and C2 in Fig. 5b cannot be kept anymore.
A 2-cycle C in M is conflicting with the key gray edge
ðrðxi1Þ; rðxjÞÞ or ðlðxiÞ; lðxjþ1ÞÞ if keeping the key gray edge
ðrðxi1Þ; rðxjÞÞ or ðlðxiÞ; lðxjþ1ÞÞ in the breakpoint graph
must destroy C. A conflicting cycle C can only be C1 and C2
as shown in Figs. 5a and 5b. Thus, a conflicting cycle must
contain one of the two black edges ðrðxi1Þ; lðxiÞÞ and
ðrðxjÞ; lðxjþ1ÞÞ. A 2-cycle is conflicting with an RS-MSP if it
is conflicting with the key gray edge of the RS-MSP.
Consider a related component U . (See Fig. 3.) In
Figs. 3a and 3b, there are two ending black edges
ðxi; xiþ1Þ and ðxjþk1; xjþkÞ at the ends of the component
U . In Figs. 3c and 3d, there are four ending black edges
ðxi; xiþ1Þ, ðxiþk1; xiþkÞ, ðyj; yjþ1Þ, and ðyjþk1; yjþkÞ at the
ends of the two segments of U . A 2-cycle in U is at the
end of U if C contains at least one of the ending black
edges.
Lemma 6. If a related component in M contains a conflicting
2-cycle, it must be at the end of the component.
Proof. Consider a 2-cycle confl ict ing with an
RS-MSP Is ¼ xi; xiþ1; . . . ; xj1; xj. (See Fig. 5.) The unique
2-cycle C of Is is an isolated 2-cycle that is not in any
related component. As discussed before, a conflicting
2-cycle must contain one of the black edges ðrðxi1Þ; lðxiÞÞ
and ðrðxjÞ; lðxjþ1ÞÞ. Note that the unique 2-cycle C
contains the two black edges ðrðxiÞ; lðxiþ1ÞÞ and
ðrðxj1Þ; lðxjÞÞ, which are adjacent to ðrðxi1Þ; lðxiÞÞ and
ðrðxjÞ; lðxjþ1ÞÞ, respectively. Thus, such a conflicting
2-cycle must be at the end of the component. tu
Lemma 6 implies that a related component in M has at
most two conflicting 2-cycles.
In our algorithm, we use Procedure CreatingRemove to
create RS-MSPs (see Fig. 6). Note that the RS-MSP will not
be created if we have to destroy two conflicting 2-cycles in
order to keep a gray edge ðrðxi1Þ; rðxjÞÞ or ðlðxiÞ; lðxjþ1ÞÞ.
4.3.2 Removing RS-MSPs
Lemma 5 shows that if we remove an RS-MSP by changing
the signs of the genes at the ends of theRS-MSP, the number
of i-cycles remains the same in the new breakpoint graph for
any i  1. Thus, in our approximation algorithm, we will
remove RS-MSPs to get a better cycle decomposition.
Lemma 7. All RS-MSPs created by Procedure CreatingRe-
move (Fig. 6) can be removed by changing the signs of the
genes at the ends of the RS-MSPs.
Proof. We consider two consecutive RS-MSPs Il and Ir.
By the definition of RS-MSP, there is at least one black
edge between Il and Ir. If there are more than one
black edge between Il and Ir, removing one RS-MSP
will not affect the other. Thus, we only have to consider
the case where there is one black edge (called the
MBE) between Il and Ir. Let Il ¼ xl; xlþ1; . . . ; xj2; xj1
and Ir ¼ xj; xjþ1; . . . ; xr1; xr. The MBE is ðrðxj1Þ; lðxjÞÞ.
There are two cases: 1) the two key gray edges
ðrðxl1Þ; rðxj1ÞÞ and ðlðxjÞ; lðxrþ1ÞÞ incident to the two
ends of the MBE are not crossing (see Fig. 7a), and
2) the two key gray edges ðrðxrÞ; rðxj1ÞÞ and
ðlðxjÞ; lðxlÞÞ incident to the two ends of the MBE are
crossing (see Fig. 7b). In case 1, after removing one
RS-MSP, say, Il, Ir is still removable. (See Fig. 7c.)
Consider case 2. First, there is no way to have more
than two consecutive RS-MSPs having MBEs and cross-
ing key gray edges. In Fig. 7b, the gray edge in the
removable cycle of Ir must have one end as rðxrÞ. Thus,
we cannot extend the third RS-MSP as case 2 with
crossing key gray edges on the right of Ir. Symmetrically,
we cannot extend the third RS-MSP on the left of Il.
Now, we show that there is no pair of input genomesA
andB that lead to case 2with two consecutiveRS-MSPs Il
and Ir, as shown in Fig. 7b. The key gray edges ðlðxlÞ; lðxjÞÞ
and ðrðxj1Þ; rðxrÞÞ in Fig. 7b indicate that xl and xj are
neighbors in B, and xj1 and xr are neighbors in B. This
will make the chromosome containing segments Il and Ir
in B become a circle instead of a string. tu
The cycle decomposition algorithm for two unsigned
genomes A and B is given in Fig. 8.

Fig. 6. The procedure CreatingRemove to create RS-MSPs.
A 2-cycle in M selected in step 4 is a selected 2-cycle. All
related 2-cycles and isolated 2-cycles in G5sðA;BÞ are
selected 2-cycles, and the other long cycles in G5sðA;BÞ are
called arbitrary cycles. In the following, let GAs ðA;BÞ be the
signed breakpoint graph obtained after steps 1-6.
Based on Procedure CreatingRemove (Fig. 6), every
RS-MSP created in step 3 has at most one conflicting
2-cycle.
Lemma 8. If creating an RS-MSP Is destroys a conflicting cycle
in M, then the removable cycle of Is is either an i-cycle with
i  3 or an arbitrary 2-cycle.
Proof. If Is has a removable 2-cycle
C ¼ rðxi1Þ; lðxiÞ; lðxjþ1Þ; rðxjÞ; rðxi1Þ;
then C cannot be a related 2-cycle. (See Fig. 3.) In Figs. 3c
and 3d, two chromosomes are involved, and thus, the
conclusion is clearly true. In Fig. 3a, the two gray edges
in the 2-cycles are parallel, but the two gray edges in C
are twisted. In Fig. 3b, all the gray edges in the
component are twisted with each other. However, in
the breakpoint graph G5sðA;BÞ, a minSP Is is inside C,
so the component contains only one 2-cycle and cannot
be extended anymore.
Moreover, C cannot be an isolated 2-cycle. If C is an
isolated 2-cycle, C is also a selected 2-cycle containing
black edges ðrðxi1Þ; lðxiÞÞ and ðrðxjÞ; lðxjþ1ÞÞ. In this
case, Is has no conflicting 2-cycle, since a conflicting
2-cycle of Is must contain one of the two black edges.
Therefore, the removable cycle of Is is either an i-cycle
with i  3 or an arbitrary 2-cycle. tu

Note that nN is the number of black edges in the
signed breakpoint graph GsðA;BÞ. Now, we can reduce
the number of black edges (number of genes) in GsðA;BÞ
by viewing a segment of consecutive genes in a
chromosome in which any two consecutive genes in the
segment are in the same 1-cycle as one gene (unless there
are two chromosomes left). The new breakpoint graph is
denoted as Gs ðA;BÞ. By doing this, the number of black
edges in Gs ðA;BÞ becomes nN  c1. Moreover, we
have

Thus,

That is, in Gs ðA;BÞ, the number of black edges is at most

that have not be assigned a sign is at most 2dsðA;BÞ.
For any   0, se t k ¼ 2 . I f dsðA;BÞ  k, then

5 ANALYSIS OF THE PERFORMANCE RATIO
In this section, we will show that the performance ratio of
the algorithm is 1:5þ  for any   0. We will focus on
inequality (2).
5.1 Analysis of 2-Cycles
Assume that a maximum match M of FAB contains
z isolated 2-cycles. A related component of M is an odd
(even) component if it has an odd (even) number of related
2-cycles. Let ro denote the number of odd related
components, ro the number of odd related components
that each contains at least one conflicting 2-cycle that are not
kept in G5sðA;BÞ, and re the number of even related
components that each contains two conflicting 2-cycles that
are not kept in G5sðA;BÞ. Let z denote the number of
conflicting isolated 2-cycles that are not kept in G5sðA;BÞ.
Let ca2 be the number of arbitrary 2-cycles in G
5
sðA;BÞ.
Lemma 9. The total number of 2-cycles in GAs ðA;BÞ
is cA2 ¼ Mj jþroþz2 ro re zþ ca2, where there are
Mj jþroþz
2 ro re z selected 2-cycles.
Proof. From Lemma 5, we know that the number of 2-cycles
in both GAs ðA;BÞ and G5sðA;BÞ is the same.
From Lemma 6, if a conflicting 2-cycle is in a related
component, it can only be a related 2-cycle at the end of a
related component. For an odd component with at least
one conflicting 2-cycle that is not kept in G5sðA;BÞ, the
number of selected 2-cycles is reduced by one. Thus, the
total number of reduced selected 2-cycles in this case is
ro. For an even component containing two conflicting
2-cycles, the number of selected 2-cycles is reduced by
one. The total number of reduced selected 2-cycles in this
case isre. There are also z isolated conflicting 2-cycles
that are not kept in G5sðA;BÞ. Therefore, the total number
of reduced selected 2-cycles is ro þre þz.
If there is no conflicting 2-cycle, we can keep
z isolated 2-cycles and Mj jþroz2 related 2-cycles. The
total of z and Mj jþroz2 is
Mj jþroþz
2 . Therefore, G
5
sðA;BÞ
contains Mj jþroþz2 ro re z selected 2-cycles. By
the definition of ca2, the total number of 2-cycles in
G5sðA;BÞ is Mj jþroþz2 ro re zþ ca2. tu
5.2 Analysis of 1 2minSPs
A minSP I ¼ xi; xiþ1; . . . ; xj1; xj contains a cycle C if all
vertices of C are in
frðxiÞ; lðxiþ1Þ; rðxiþ1Þ; . . . ; lðxj1Þ; rðxj1Þ; lðxjÞg:
A cycle C is outside I if no vertex of C is in
frðxiÞ; lðxiþ1Þ; rðxiþ1Þ; . . . ; lðxj1Þ; rðxj1Þ; lðxjÞg.
AminSP is a 1 2 isolatedminSP if the cycles contained
in the minSP are either isolated 2-cycles or 1-cycles. Let sm
be the number of 1 2 isolated minSPs with at least two
isolated 2-cycles and ss be the number of 1 2 isolated
minSPs with exactly one isolated 2-cycle in G5sðA;BÞ. By
the definitions, all S-MSPs in G5sðA;BÞ are 1 2 isolated
minSPs with exactly one isolated 2-cycle, and the number
of S-MSPs in G5sðA;BÞ is also ss. The total number of
1 2 isolated minSPs in G5sðA;BÞ is sm þ ss. Let sa denote
the number of 1 2minSPs in G5sðA;BÞ, each of them
contains at least one arbitrary 2-cycle.
Proposition 1. If a minSP of G5sðA;BÞ contains a related
2-cycle, then the minSP contains at least one arbitrary cycle.
The proof of the proposition is exactly the same as that of
Lemma 3 in the full version of [4]. By Proposition 1, we
immediately have the following lemma:
Lemma 10. The total number of 1 2minSP s in G5sðA;BÞ is
sm þ ss þ sa.
Consider the ss S-MSPs in G
5
sðA;BÞ. They can be
classified into three groups: 1) There are sn S-MSPs that
do not have the key gray edge. This kind of S-MSPs do not
correspond to any CRS-MSPs in GðA;BÞ. 2) There are
st S-MSPs in G
5
sðA;BÞ that correspond to CRS-MSPs in the
unsigned breakpoint graph and are not transformed into
RS-MSPs in Procedure CreatingRemove (Fig. 6). 3) There
are sr S-MSPs in G
5
sðA;BÞ that correspond to CRS-MSPs in
the unsigned breakpoint graph and are transformed into
RS-MSPs. The sr S-MSPs are removed in step 6 of the cycle
decomposition algorithm. Therefore, we have
ss ¼ sn þ st þ sr: ð5Þ
Consider the sr RS-MSPs in G
5
sðA;BÞ. Let s3r denote the
number of RS-MSPs with removable i-cycles for i  3.
Removing the s3r RS-MSPs with removable i-cycles for i  3
will not create a new 1 2minSP . Moreover, removing an
RS-MSP with a removable 2-cycle will create a new
1 2minSP . There are s3r 1 2 minSPs in G5sðA;BÞ that
are not in GAs ðA;BÞ. Thus,
sA2 ¼ sm þ ss þ sa  s3r : ð6Þ
Consider the RS-MSPs in G5sðA;BÞ that are removed in
step 6 of the cycle decomposition algorithm, and their
removable cycles are 2-cycles. By Lemma 8, the removable
2-cycles can only be isolated 2-cycles or arbitrary 2-cycles.
Let sir denote the number of such RS-MSPs with removable

with removable arbitrary 2-cycles. We have
sr ¼ s3r þ sar þ sir: ð7Þ
5.3 Important Inequalities
Let zin be the number of isolated 2-cycles in minSPs in
G5sðA;BÞ and zout be the number of isolated 2-cycles outside
any minSP in G5sðA;BÞ. By definitions, z ¼ zþ zin þ zout.
We use the following lemma to bound zout:
Lemma 11. zout  st þ sir. (The proof is given in Appendix A.)
By the definitions of sm and ss, zin  2sm þ ss. From
Lemma 11 and (5) and (7), we have
z  2sm þ 2ss  sn  sar  s3r þz: ð8Þ
Lemma 12. s3r  ro þ 2re þz sar .
Proof. Note that M contains at least ro þ 2re þz
conflicting 2-cycles destroyed by Procedure Creating
Remove (Fig. 6) . Thus, there are at least
ro þ 2re þz RS-MSPs created by destroying the
conflicting 2-cycles. By Lemma 8, the number of
RS-MSPs destroying conflicting 2-cycles is not greater
than s3r þ sar . Thus, s3r þ sar  ro þ 2re þz. The
lemma holds. tu
The following lemma set up the connection between the
parameters c2 and s
 (defined in Lemma 3) and the
parameters jMj and sn in the approximation algorithm:
Lemma 13. jMj  c2  sn  s, where jMj is the size of the
maximum match in FAB . (The proof is given in Appendix B.)
5.4 The Performance Ratio
Now, we are ready to show that the performance ratio is
1:5þ .
Theorem 2. If fðAÞ ¼ 0, then the performance ratio of
Algorithm 1 is 1.5.
Proof. By step 1 of the cycle decomposition algorithm,
cA1 ¼ c1. From Lemma 4, we only have to prove that

G5sðA;BÞ has at least sa arbitrary 2-cycles in minSPs and
sar arbitrary 2-cycles as removable cycles of some
RS-MSPs, ca2  sa þ sar holds. Thus, (11) becomes

Theorem 3. The performance ratio of Algorithm 1 is 1:5þ .
Proof. For any   0, set k ¼ 2 . Assume that dðA;BÞ  k.
The number of all possible 1-cycles in GðA;BÞ is no less
than nN  2k. We can find the optimal solution in
step 1 of the algorithm. Otherwise, the translocation
distance dðA;BÞ ¼ t > k. In this case, we use steps 2 and
3 to compute an approximation solution with distance x.
From Theorem 2, we have x  1:5tþ fA  1:5tþ 2,

APPENDIX A
PROOF OF LEMMA 11
Proof. By definition, G5sðA;BÞ contains sir isolated 2-cycles
as removable 2-cycles of some RS-MSPs. Thus, zout  sir.
Consider the st S-MSPs in G
5
sðA;BÞ that correspond
to CRS-MSPs in the unsigned breakpoint graph and are
not transformed into RS-MSPs in Procedure Creating
Remove (Fig. 6). We want to show that such st S-MSPs
correspond to st isolated 2-cycles outside minSPs that
cannot be removable 2-cycles. Therefore, we can con-
clude that zout  st þ sir.
First, consider the case that st ¼ 1. Let I ¼
xi; xiþ1; . . . ; xj1; xj denote such an S-MSP. The unique
2-cycle in I is C ¼ rðxiÞ; lðxiþ1Þ; lðxjÞ; rðxj1Þ; rðxiÞ.
Without loss of generality, we assume that GðA;BÞ
contains gray edge ðxi; xjþ1Þ. (See Fig. 5a.) The reason
that I is not transformed into RS-MSP in Procedure
CreatingRemove (Fig. 6) is that the key gray edge
ðlðxiÞ; lðxjþ1ÞÞ has two conflicting 2-cycles in M. Let C1
and C2 be the two conflicting 2-cycles, where
C1 ¼ rðxi1Þ; lðxiÞ; rðxjþ1Þ; lðxjþ2Þ; rðxi1Þ, and C2 con-
tains black edge ðrðxjÞ; lðxjþ1ÞÞ. (See Fig. 5a.) A
conflicting 2-cycle can be a related 2-cycle or an
isolated 2-cycle. Now, we prove that C2 is an isolated
2-cycle. First, the cycle C2 cannot be related to C since
C is an isolated 2-cycle. Suppose C2 is related to C1.
The two gray edges ðlðxiÞ; rðxjþ1ÞÞ and ðrðxi1Þ; lðxjþ2ÞÞ
in C1 are parallel. If C1 and C2 are in a related
64 IEEE/ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND BIOINFORMATICS, VOL. 5, NO. 1, JANUARY 2008
component, it must be of the same type as that in
Fig. 3a. However, the black edge in C2 that is not
ðrðxjÞ; lðxjþ1ÞÞ cannot be in the range ½xi1; xjþ2. (See
Fig. 5a.) Thus, C1 and C2 cannot be in a related
component. The case in Fig. 5b is symmetric. There-
fore, when st ¼ 1, zout  st þ sir. The 2-cycle C2 in
Figs. 5a and 5b is called the key 2-cycle. Clearly, any
key 2-cycle cannot be a removable cycle for any
RS-MSP.
Now, consider the case that st  2. Let Ia ¼
xi; xiþ1; . . . ; xj1; xj and Ib ¼ yi; yiþ1; . . . ; yj1; yj be two
of such st S-MSPs. Let Ca and Cb be the key 2-cycles of Ia
and Ib, respectively. If Ca and Cb are not identical, then
we can conclude that there are at least st isolated 2-cycles
outside minSPs and zout  st þ sir.
In the rest of the proof, we will show that Ca and Cb
are not identical.
For the S-MSP Ia, without loss of generality, assume
that xj > xi. For the S-MSP Ib, let ymin be the minimum
of yi and yj, and ymax be the maximum of yi and yj. Ia
contains all genes with their values in ½xi; xj, and Ib
contains all genes with their values in ½ymin; ymax.
We will show that if Ca and Cb are identical, then
½ymin; ymax  ½xi; xj. This contradicts the fact that Ia and
Ib are two distinct S-MSPs.
Suppose Ca and Cb are identical. Let C
 denote the
identical 2-cycle. C contains two black edges, where one
black edge is ðrðxi1Þ; lðxiÞÞ or ðrðxjÞ; lðxjþ1ÞÞ, and the
other is ðrðyi1Þ; lðyiÞÞ or ðrðyjÞ; lðyjþ1ÞÞ. Some cases arise.
We assume that Ia and Ib are on the same chromosome.
The cases that Ia and Ib are on different chromosomes are
the same. The following fact is crucial and is repeatedly
used in the proof.
Fact 1. Ia contains all genes with their values in the
segment ½xi; xj, and every gene appears only once.
Case 1. C contains two gray edges that are twisted.
The possible locations of C are illustrated in Figs. 10a,
10c, and 10e. Another case is to reverse the direction of
the chromosome in Fig. 10c and is symmetric.
In Fig. 10a, the existence of gray edges ðlðxiÞ; rðxjþ1ÞÞ
implies that xjþ1 ¼ xi  1 or xjþ1 ¼ xi þ 1. From fact 1,
we can conclude that only xjþ1 ¼ xi  1 holds. The
existence of gray edge ðrðxjÞ; rðyi1ÞÞ indicates that
yi1 ¼ xj þ 1 or yi1 ¼ xj  1. Again, Fact 1 implies that
only yi1 ¼ xj þ 1 holds. Similarly, by gray edge
ðlðyi1Þ; rðyjÞÞ, we have yj ¼ yi1 þ 1 or yj ¼ yi1  1.
However, it is impossible that yj ¼ yi1  1 ¼ xj. (It
contradicts the fact that each gene appears once.)
Therefore, we have yj ¼ yi1 þ 1 ¼ xj þ 2. By gray edge
ðlðxjþ1Þ; lðyiÞÞ, we have
yi ¼ xjþ1  1 ¼ xi  2:
(It is impossible that yi ¼ xjþ1 þ 1 ¼ xi. ) Thus,
ymin ¼ yi ¼ xi  2, and ymax ¼ yj ¼ xj þ 2. Therefore,
½ymin; ymax  ½xi; xj. The cases in Figs. 10c and 10e are
left for readers.
Case 2. C contains two gray edges that are parallel.
The possible locations of C are illustrated in
Figs. 10b, 10d, and 10f. Another case is to reverse the
chromosome in Fig. 10d and is symmetric.
In Fig. 10b, from gray edges ðlðxiÞ; rðxjþ1ÞÞ and
ðrðxjÞ; lðyiÞÞ, we have xjþ1 ¼ xi  1 and yi ¼ xj þ 1. From
gray edge ðlðxjþ1Þ; rðyi1ÞÞ, we have
yi1 ¼ xjþ1  1 ¼ xi  2:
(It is impossible that yi1 ¼ xjþ1 þ 1 ¼ xi.) From gray
edge ðlðyi1Þ; rðyjÞÞ, we have yj ¼ yi1  1 ¼ xi  3.
(It is impossible that yj ¼ yi1 þ 1 ¼ xjþ1.) Thus,
ymin ¼ yj ¼ xi  3, and ymax ¼ yi ¼ xj þ 1. Therefore,
½ymin; ymax  ½xi; xj. The cases in Figs. 10d and 10f
are left for readers. tu
APPENDIX B
PROOF OF LEMMA 13
Proof. Since GsðA;BÞ contains all possible 1-cycles, by the
construction of FAB , Mj j  c2  0. Thus, we only have to
consider the case, where sn  s  0. By the definitions of
sn and s
, GAs ðA;BÞ contains at least ðsn  sÞ S-MSPs
that are not in GsðA;BÞ, and those S-MSPs do not
correspond to any CRS-MSPs either.
Let Is ¼ xi; xiþ1; . . . ; xj1; xj denote one of the
sn  sS-MSPs. Since no S-MSP in GsðA;BÞ corresponds
to Is, the 2-cycle rðxiÞ; lðxiþ1Þ; lðxjÞ; rðxj1Þ; rðxiÞ does not
exist in GsðA;BÞ. Note that all 1-cycles between the black
edges ðrðxiÞ; lðxiþ1ÞÞ and ðrðxj1Þ; lðxjÞÞ are kept, and
GsðA;BÞ must contain at least one of gray edges
ðlðxiÞ; rðxj1ÞÞ and ðlðxiþ1Þ; rðxjÞÞ. Three cases arise:
Case 1 (Fig. 11a). ðlðxiÞ; rðxj1ÞÞ is in GsðA;BÞ, butðlðxiþ1Þ; rðxjÞÞ is not in GsðA;BÞ. Since all the 1-cycles
between the two black edges ðrðxiÞ; lðxiþ1ÞÞ and
ðrðxj1Þ; lðxjÞÞ are kept, gray edge ðlðxiþ1Þ; lðxjÞÞ must
be in GsðA;BÞ. Thus, the two black edges ðrðxiÞ; lðxiþ1ÞÞ

identical.
and ðrðxj1Þ; lðxjÞÞ are connected by the gray edge
ðlðxiþ1Þ; lðxjÞÞ. Since gray edge ðlðxiÞ; rðxj1ÞÞ (not gray
edge ðrðxiÞ; rðxj1ÞÞ) is in GsðA;BÞ, the two black edgesðrðxiÞ; lðxiþ1ÞÞ and ðrðxj1Þ; lðxjÞÞ must be in an i-cycle,
with i  3.
Case 2 (Fig. 11b). ðlðxiþ1Þ; rðxjÞÞ is in GsðA;BÞ, butðlðxiÞ; rðxj1ÞÞ is not in GsðA;BÞ. It is symmetric to the
case 1, shown in Fig. 11a.
Case 3 (Figs. 11c and 11d). Both gray edges
ðlðxiÞ; rðxj1ÞÞ and ðlðxiþ1Þ; rðxjÞÞ are in GsðA;BÞ. In
this case, black edges ðrðxiÞ; lðxiþ1ÞÞ and ðrðxjÞ; lðxjþ1ÞÞ
are in cycle C, and black edges ðrðxi1Þ; lðxiÞÞ and
ðrðxj1Þ; lðxjÞÞ are in cycle C0. C and C0 might be
merged into one cycle (see Fig. 11c) or might be two
different cycles (see Fig. 11d). By definition, GðA;BÞ
does not contain gray edges ðxi1; xjÞ and ðxi; xjþ1Þ.
Thus, GsðA;BÞ has no gray edges ðrðxi1Þ; lðxjÞÞ andðrðxiÞ; lðxjþ1ÞÞ, and therefore, both C and C0 are
i-cycles, with i  3. Thus, the two black edges
ðrðxiÞ; lðxiþ1ÞÞ and ðrðxj1Þ; lðxjÞÞ must be in one or
two i-cycles, with i  3.
Changing at least one of the signs of xi and xj in
GsðA;BÞ to obtain an S-MSP can only destroy the
cycle(s) containing at least one of black edges
ðrðxiÞ; lðxiþ1ÞÞ and ðrðxj1Þ; lðxjÞÞ. This will increase the
number of 2-cycles by at least one. Thus, we can change
the signs of the genes in GsðA;BÞ and obtain theðsn  sÞ S-MSPs. By doing this, the number of 2-cycles
is increased by at least ðsn  sÞ. Therefore, we have
Mj j  c2 þ sn  s. The lemma holds. tu
